   ACT II
   <br/>
   Network Attacks
  </h2>
  <p align="left">
   You've hacked your neighbors Wi-Fi or you're connected to your local coffee shop Wi-Fi and not sure where to hack next?! How do you push your freshly purchased ransomware onto everyone on the network?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course will teach you how to hack others while on their Wi-Fi network.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Act II you'll be given the tools and techniques needed to compromise others once you've gained access to their network. Hopefully you've gone through Act I and already know how to hack Wi-Fi networks and now you want more information. This course builds on what you've learned in Act I teaching you the next step in hacking. It's time to compromise everyone on the network that you're on and own that local coffee shop ;)
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course is part of a multi-part hacking guide series that is meant for people who wish to learn how to become a hacker or cybercriminal. This guide is original with pictures and screenshots to asssit with your learning.

   Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal for numbers of years I've opted into creating high quality course for the people who can afford them. I'll share my knowledge for anyone who is able to put some money on the table to get up to date hacking information. At the time of this writing this has only been sold to a few but now I'd like to open it up to the many. I can't sell my book at Waterstones so here we are.

   This course isn't for everyone and is not designed to hold your hand all the way through. It does include resources, articles, and links that you should read, understand, and be able to apply the knowledge learned in order to be successful and to maximize this guide.

   These courses are designed to fill that "void" as a beginner hacker or future cybercriminal while learning your new found skills (using a RAT, deploying ransomware, adware, phishing, etc.).
