   This course is designed for the type of cyber criminal who's looking for more information on how to commit online scams and the infrastructure required for them to be successful. More importantly though, this course is meant for individuals looking to host their own website/hidden service within the Tor network while feeling confident that it's secured properly and that you're protected from other hackers or from law enforcement exposing your server.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Whether you're looking for more knowledge surrounding online scams, creating your own webpage in order to spread your scam page propaganda to the masses or looking to setup a forum to discuss taking over the world this course will help you set it up securely and properly. You'll learn the ins and outs of hidden services and you'll be able to follow along with no technical experience required.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each online scammer that lurks in cyber criminal world has their own operations and the online scam artist type of cyber criminal can usually be self-sufficient without the need for working with others. If you keep a finger in each cyber crime operation you can begin to build your operations and diversify yourself. Compromising individuals with RATs, ransomware, and other malware can be profitable because you can sell their accounts, use their accounts for your own gain, get paid in crypto from your ransomware campaigns, etc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You can develop your own small carding operations and begin to make money this way and as you come to realize if you're putting the time, effort, and work into yourself you'll have plenty of avenues of income coming in monthly. Online scammers are just using another way of making money online in the shadows to add to your cookbook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course, at its core, is designed to help you setup and secure your own hidden service website within the Tor network but we'll also be going into much detail on running online scams with examples to help you formulate your own devious plans. You'll be able to host your propaganda madness for everyone to read, buy your products, or be scammed from. By completing this course, you will gain the knowledge of how online scams are performed and the confidence that your onion website is secured so law enforcement (LE) and others can't fuck with your hidden service. You'll have a much better understanding on how hidden services are hacked and how to prevent that from happening to the best of your ability.

   Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal for numbers of years I've opted into creating high quality course for the people who can afford them. I'll share my knowledge for anyone who is able to put some money on the table to get up to date hacking information. At the time of this writing this has only been sold to a few but now I'd like to open it up to the many. I can't sell my book at Waterstones so here we are.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   - Online scams

   This course isn't for everyone and is not designed to hold your hand all the way through. It does include resources, articles, and links that you should read, understand, and be able to apply the knowledge learned in order to be successful and to maximize this guide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These courses are designed to fill that "void" as a beginner hacker or future cybercriminal while learning your new found skills by diversifying your new found cyber criminal knowledge.
