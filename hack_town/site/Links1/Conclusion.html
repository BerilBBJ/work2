     Conclusion
    </p>
    You should be familiar, if not very comfortable, with what has been discussed in this course. Remember hacking does not happen overnight so it's best to constantly practice to become more efficient and effective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Every place you setup shop try taking over as many Wi-Fi networks in the area as you can. We know that you can target "all" networks using wifite and let it run automatically in the background for you. There's no reason you can't do this while sipping your coffee at the same time. The more WiFi networks you're able to use the better it will be for you. Nothing better than sitting at a coffee shop using the WiFi across the street to launch your attacks. Use a different network every time you can and move around if possible. Before you know it you'll have 30+ Wifi networks to use. This will increase the chance of remaining anonymous and reducing the risk of being caught or tracked to one location should something occur.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should be able to be a ghost online using other Wi-Fi networks with your OPSec on point by now if you've been following along in order with the courses at HackTown. You should know how to hide your tracks and prevent from being indeitified while launching a cyber attack, posting online somewhere, checking your vendor account, hacking the planet, or doing anything that's questionable online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Building on this knowledge ACT II consists of what to do once you've hacked onto a Wi-Fi network and how to target the individual(s) on the network for profit and pirating. This includes up to date Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, malware delivery, and sniffing on the network.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The hacker maniacs who are reading this wanting more knowledge I suggest researching "Ethical hacking", "penetration tester", and "pen tester". I don't know your hacking knowledge level but for those who are like WHATTTTTT THE FUCK IS THAT these are the search terms that will allow you to follow up on the "professional" careers in hacking. The point is to educate yourself on how professional hackers operate against certain websites/organizations that have hired them to hack their company so you can begin to adopt their methodologies for your own goals of taking over the world. You can download the "Certified Ethical Hacking course" from any torrenting website and read at your leisure along side these courses at HackTown to dive deep. It's highly recommended to do as it will help your knowledge base moving forward to cyber criminal master.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stay focused when learning everything here if this is all new to you and make sure your comfortable with everything before moving forward. Like any University, college, or any other acedemia shit doesn't happen over night and realistically expect this to be just a long. Don' get lost down the rabbit hole.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you enjoyed Act I. Until next time comrades.
