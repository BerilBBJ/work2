     Introduction
    </p>
    This course was written by me, Funshine. Who the fuck I am? I was a freelance Blackhat, nation state contractor, dark web phisher, spoofer, forum lurking master, ex-associate (ish) at well-known hacking firm, who made a lot of money through my cybercrime career. Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal, I've hung up my black hat and retired filling my time to create high quality cybercriminal courses for the people who take the time to find and read them. I'm creating courses from my experience that you can duplicate and launch on your own to be profitable as I was.

    First off there is no one way of doing things especially in hacking. These courses are not the word of law when it comes to hacking but they are told from my perspective so if you have something to add, have a better way of explaining things, or anything you think that I don't know that pertains to the topics in these course send me a god damn email and let me know what is WAT. That way we can keep it all updated for everyone to enjoy and cause a fuck show in their home towns. HackTown will arm you with the right information on cyber warfare which is exactly what you're wanting to learn. Good job my friend you found this place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This course is meant to teach you how to hack Wi-Fi networks for your own personal gain and to ensure you're not using your own Wi-Fi network when you're doing questionable shit online. This is another important skill to learn when beginning out with your cybercriminal career. Hopefully you can take away many useful points that you're able to incorporate into your daily mayhem causing activities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's assumed you have general knowledge of hacker techniques, lingo, interests, and terminology that is used in this course. This document has been reviewed however there may be some language and grammatical errors as translation sometimes get misunderstand. If you come across errors (spelling or grammar) or have more information that you think can be added please let me know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, this course does not include EVERYTHING for you. Honestly how could it? It's expected that you're capable of doing some research on your own as well. These teachings will show you how to stay and remain hidden but you cannot be expected to be spoon fed with hand holding along the way. Google is your friend. Any question, problem, or error paste it directly into Google and read through forums, blogs, etc. until you find your answer. If you're not capable of this then please stop now before you hurt yourself. You may think this is a cop out but most, if not all, of your questions can be answered this way and realistically the amount of questions you'll have will be vast so it's best to get efficient in searching and finding your answers on your own.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being able to effectively search, read, learn, and find your answer is a skill on its own so be prepared to be somewhat self-sufficient. YouTube has a large number of videos that can walk you through your problem, literally, at the basic level. Having trouble installing VMware or VirtualBox? Having trouble getting dnsspoof to work? Google it or use YouTube. Use the internet to your advantage without compromising yourself and begin to become self-sufficient. Most people who are good at hacking, carding, etc. have learned step by step from books, others, whatever means they needed to so treat this knowledge like a University or College course and do some homework and read, read, and read some more. If you have major problems following this guide and cannot replicate the teachings then what you're attempting to do and learn is way beyond your capabilities and you should stop what you're doing, accept your fate, and focus on something easier such as cabinet making, cake baking, or watching the world pass you by.
