     Hacking Wi-Fi Networks
    </p>
    Instead of explaining every technical detail about WEP, WPS, and WPA/WPA2 networks I'll redirect you to an excellent resource as this topic has been explained, literally to death, across many hacker forums on the internet. However, most of the stuff out there is outdated or people just don't know what they're talking about which can lead to confusion. On top of that Kali has been updated and some syntax that is floating around on hacker forums no longer works and people get bogged down in misinformation land. If I'm part of a group or forum and I see "How do I hack Wi-Fi networks?" posted I literally shit my pants in disbelief. Specially on a darknet hacking forum. Like how the fuck did you get here?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's one of the most annoying topics to answer in the forums but that being said getting everything to work properly is always a hurdle for people. Having the right information and up to date stuff is something to be said so I've linked very helpful videos for you. Now keep in mind most of the stuff talked about on the videos will work (WEP and WPA/WPA2 attacks) except a few items. The videos are meant to explain all the technical aspects of how to hack Wi-Fi networks for those wanting to know the deep technicalities of it all. It's a very good watch and very informative.

    You should have already purchased the required Wi-Fi hacking equipment explained in the last chapter (network cards and optional associated antennas) to continue from here on in. If you have not yet purchased the required items you should do so now as without having the right equipment following along with this chapter is a waste of time and cannot be completed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alright let's start.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Open VirtualBox and fire up your Kali VM. Once Kali fully boots up plug in your Alfa network card one at a time into your laptop and once you've plugged them in go to File - Devices - USB adaptor to select the Alfa Wi-Fi network card and ensure it has a check mark beside it to ensure it's connected to the Kali VM so we can use it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From here on in its assumed you know what WEP, WPA/WPA2, and WPS networks are and their vulnerabilities. As attackers we like to start with the lowest hanging fruit and work our way from there. Finding WEP/WPS networks is fading out due to their insecurities but it's always a good idea to check around for it because you never know!
    <br/>

    You will need (2) wireless cards (Alfa cards) to maximize the next methods to the fullest. If you only have (1) Alfa network card you'll be limited in what you'll be able to attack.
    <br/>
    Make sure you have (2) wireless network cards plugged in and recognized in your Kali VM.

        Running "sudo airmon-ng check kill" should be used every time you launch Wi-Fi attacks to ensure there is no other applications that will interfere with our attacks. Good habit to do this every time you plan on hacking a Wi-Fi network.

       <br/>

    There's no need to manually put your Wi-Fi network cards into monitor mode as the program discussed below will do it for you if required.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the newest Kali 2020+ I find that the newest wifite2 has numerous problems with certain Wi-Fi network cards. Version 2.2.5 seems to be the most stable IMO.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In Kali VM:
    <br/>
    <font color="red">
     <b>
      sudo airmon-ng check kill
      <br/>
      sudo wifite
     </b>
    </font>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Select the Wi-Fi network card to use and let the wifite tool run for around 60 seconds.  Once that's done hit CTRL+C and select the Wi-Fi network you're wanting to target. It's best to ensure there are clients already associated to the Wi-Fi network you're targeting to cycle through every attack (ie: WPA/WPA2) against it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    wifite uses a default wordlist when cracking the 4-way handshake but you can specify which wordlist to use. The default wordlist is a good place to start.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A nice feature of the wifite tool is instead of specifically targeting one Wi-Fi network you can tell wifite to attack "all" Wi-Fi networks in the area around you. Since this tool is automated you could kick back and do other things while wifite works in the background and goes after all the lowest hanging fruit around you. Very nice! Get high!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Any hotel you stay at, coffee house you sit at, friends place you go to, or anywhere you have a potential to use an internet connection you should try hacking into every Wi-Fi network around you possible so you have multiple networks you can use when online causing fucking havoc. Do this because you want to have multiple Wi-Fi networks that you can use for your own needs. The more Wi-Fi networks you have access to the better. Once you begin to add more and more Wi-Fi networks that you have taken over to your list you can start to use each Wi-Fi network at different dates and times. If you live in a dense urban area it's best to have 50+ Wi-Fi networks and use a different one each day, every other day, etc. Before you know it you'll be able to log into a Wi-Fi network that you won't be logging into again for well over 2 months. Constantly changing locations and Wi-Fi networks for your "business" activities makes you very difficult to locate if someone is onto your activities. Keep mobile.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, when you continue on to the next course the more Wi-Fi networks you hack onto the more targets you have to potentially infect with malware, ransomware, RATs, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Build your Wi-Fi network empire every chance you can! If you travel or constantly move around you can see why this is important, better for your anonymity, and makes you a very difficult target to track. Imagine the time and man power associated into finding and tracking you? The financial costs associated with this means you have to be a target that's worth the time, money, efforts, and worst-case scenario after they try and trace IP after IP they associate you to a geographical area, hacked Wi-Fi network, or a public Wi-Fi. Again, if you move around a lot, travel, or are constantly on the move the better it will be for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now at some point you're going to realize you're not able to crack every Wi-Fi network you come across and not every Wi-Fi network can be cracked or hacked. It depends on a lot of factors like signal strength, location, password complexity, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Signal strength is very important when targeting Wi-Fi networks with success. The physical barriers that are in between you and the target Wi-Fi network can and will interfere with your attacks. Just because you see great signal strength when using these programs sometimes can be misleading so keep an open mind when you see %100 signal strength. If you're unable to launch an attack against a Wi-Fi network it might be because of these reasons such as walls, metal, other radio interferences, objects, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll soon find out some passwords you're just unable to crack due to the complexity of them (IE: a password of "12wedsW24#5$ETRgerfsf"). It's very common not being able to crack the WPA/WPA2 password if they've used a proper password to secure it. If you cannot crack it then you'll want to move onto an "Evil Twin attack" to trick the users into entering their WPA/WPA2 password. You'll learn about this in the next chapter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that you understand how to hack Wi-Fi networks go sit in a parking lot with a directional antenna pointed towards a foreign embassy and hack their shit you fucking spy.
