     Anonymous Crypto
    </p>
    Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), Zerocoin(zcash), cash, and pre-paid credit cards purchased with cash are the best options to use when purchasing items when it comes to staying anonymous. Since BTC is the most commonly used cryptocurrency it's always good to have some that's completely anonymous for you to use freely. It's important to purchase and deposit BTC the most anonymous way possible as we know the blockchain is a public ledger therefore, theoretically, it can be tracked if you're not careful. Especially if you're using cryptocurrency exchanges. We want to avoid our transactions from being tracked for obvious reasons. Purchasing BTC will vary from person to person depending which country you reside in and some methods may not work for everyone. You should never trust any third party to store your BTC so don't keep them in an online wallet for long if you have to. It's most best to use an offline wallet
    <br/>
    <br/>
    https://localbitcoins.com recently stopped in person cash buying/selling of BTC as of June 1, 2019. This method is no longer viable which is annoying but honestly it doesn't matter. Google "BTC ATMs" or go to https://coinatmradar.com and see if there are any BTC ATMs in your area you can use. Simply follow the directions on the ATM and buy BTC with cash. You'll need a BTC wallet either on your tablet or mobile device. Most wallets are very straight forward and can be downloaded from Google Play or the App Store. You can also check good old craigslist.org to meet-up in person to buy BTC for cash.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you'd rather purchase BTC online from a cryptocurrency exchange be aware it might take a few days to register and be approved depending on which exchange you use. Some exchanges to check out are:
    <br/>

    There are so many exchanges these days so pick whichever one you feel comfortable with:

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using cryptocurrency exchangers is all legit and legal so don't flip your lid about registering because you're not committing a crime. You're simply purchasing an asset and nothing about that is illegal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Using exchanges to buy and sell cryptocurrencies does present an OPSec problem as most online exchangers require you to register with your real information. Giving out your REAL information for anything is always a problem surrounding criminal/hacking activities. I know that doesn't sound great
    <u>
     however
    </u>
    we're going to use the latest technology to help "wash" our coins and stay anonymous so no need to overly stress out about this shit. If you don't purchase BTC from a BTC ATM, craigslist, etc. then you'll need to purchase BTC from an online exchange with whichever method you prefer (Paypal, bank account, credit card, etc.).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you have some BTC we'll "wash" your BTC and exchange it for Monero (XMR) and then exchange your XMR back into BTC again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Converting your BTC into XMR, sending that XMR to another XMR address, and then converting back into BTC again will cut the connection to you making your crypto completely anonymous to spend on whatever your heart desires (heroin and crack most likely). This will also give you the ability to convert that tainted BTC into clean BTC making it untraceable. It's also recommended to use this method each time you plan on cashing out whatever crypto currency you're dealing with. For example, you made $1000 in BTC from infecting people with ransomware or you're a vendor and want to cash out the BTC you've made then you'll want to convert that BTC into XMR, send the XMR to another XMR wallet you control, and convert back again into BTC (or whatever cryptocurrency) before "cashing out". We want to ensure your hard earned crypto is completely anonymous and safe to put into your account if you choose to do so.  Once converted into XMR you can consider it "washed" and technically untraceable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Monero (XMR) was designed specifically with privacy in mind as is not traceable as of today. Unsure of what XMR is? Use Google or watch a YouTube video about it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Alright it's assumed you have some BTC to be converted.
    <br/>
    You'll first need to create a Monero (XMR) wallet and the easiest way of doing this is to utilize the online wallet:
    <br/>
    https://wallet.mymonero.com
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you have a Monero wallet then you want to convert your BTC to XMR and back again by utilizing the following sites:

      <br/>
      https://localmonero.co
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </b>
    </font>
    Once you have your BTC that you consider safe you'll want to use a wallet on your computer or an online wallet (https://blockchain.info).

    If you're strictly wanting an online wallet to store your BTC then make sure you're using an online wallet that can be accessible over Tor. Use Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) to login into the blockchain.info hidden service (https://blockchainbdgpzk.onion or https://blockchain.info), click wallet, and then create a new wallet. It should be noted that you will need JS to login to the wallet. Yes JS! Record all the required details needed for the account and make sure you can login properly before sending any Bitcoin (BTC) to or from it. Store your credentials somewhere safe. It should be noted that the blockchain onion address tends to fuck up a lot so be aware.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're using Whonix then you don't have to install any other offline wallet as the Electrum wallet is already installed for you. You just need to open the application in Whonix and set it up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that you have your wallets setup to run through Tor you can feel secure when sending/receiving BTC and since we converted our original purchased BTC into XMR and back again we can feel confident the BTC we've converted is anonymous and secure to spend it as we please. Or cash out your millions, whichever.
