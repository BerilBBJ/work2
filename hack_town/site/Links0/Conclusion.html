     Conclusion
    </p>
    You should be familiar, if not very comfortable, with what has been discussed in this course. It's a good idea to read through this course fully before deciding on what to implement on your end to enhance your OPSec.  Hacking does not happen overnight so it's best to constantly practice to become more efficient and effective.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As you can imagine there's no one right way of doing things so whatever you decide to implement from this course just remember your laptop should have NO personal information on it and should be strictly used for work purposes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You should now have a better understanding of how to stay and remain anonymous online while enhancing your OPSec. Hopefully you've learned something from this course and can add another key piece of information to your hacker mind set before unleashing into the wild. Like any course or tutorial this is not perfect so if you see typos, spelling errors, or have useful information to add please email me. This course takes the first step in informing you of how to hide your tracks and prevent you from being followed while launching a cyber attack, posting somewhere, or doing anything that's questionable online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You need to be in the know. What I mean is just because you downloaded Tor, Whonix, or Tails last year doesn't mean it's secure so follow cyber related news on FaceBook, Twitter, or whatever means you have available. You need to keep your applications, OS, passwords, systems, etc. updated and to current versions. You need to ensure everything keeps updated and pay attention to dark web news, Tor project, and especially arrests surrounding cybercrime as this is where you'll learn the newest methods used to catch cybercriminals and what's not safe anymore should something be compromised (Tor, Tails, PGP, etc.).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now that you know how to remain anonymous online, we can begin to build on this foundation and move onto Act I of the cybercriminal/hacker series. In the next course (ACT I) it will consist of how to hack Wi-Fi networks around you and use them for your own needs. This is another key piece when increasing your OPSec because we don't want to use our own Wi-Fi network since we know this is a bad idea now yes?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, if you're looking at becoming a efficient and effective hacker it's best to research "Ethical hacker", "penetration tester", and "pen tester". These are the search terms that will allow you to follow up on the "professional" careers in hacking. The point of doing this research is to see how professional hackers test certain websites/organizations and begin to adopt their methodologies for your own goals. You can download the "Certified Ethical Hacking course" from any torrenting website and read at your leisure. It's highly recommended to do so to fully grasp the hacking knowledge used today and will help you greatly.

      To hammer home the points:
      <br/>
     </b>
     <li>
      Your "work" computer should never ever have anything personally related to your real identity. Ever!
     </li>
     <li>
      Your host machine should have Anti-Virus or Windows Defender enabled.
     </li>
     <li>
      Your host machine should always be kept up to date with current updates.
     </li>
     <li>
      Your host machine should have full HD encryption.
     </li>
     <li>
      Your host machine should have opensnitch, Glasswire, or Littlesnitch installed.
     </li>
     <li>
      Your host machine should have booting from USB disabled in the BIOS settings.
     </li>
     <li>
      Your host machine should have a VPN running on it.
     </li>
     <li>
      Everything should be saved to the USB and never the HD.
     </li>
     <li>
      A password manager should be used for storing your passwords.
     </li>
     <li>
      VM should be saved onto on a USB/Micro SD and encrypted.
     </li>
     <li>
      Whonix should be used to conduct all your dark web activities.
     </li>
     <li>
      Spoof your MAC and Computer Name every time on start-up and shutdown.
     </li>
     <li>
      Use CCleaner, bleachbit, or similar programs on your host machine before each shutdown.
     </li>
     <li>
      Be conscious of other devices you may have on your person that are giving away your location (cell phones are not your friends).
     </li>
