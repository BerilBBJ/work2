     Anonymous E-mails
    </p>
    You'll eventually need an e-mail addresses to register, sign-up, and communicate with clients, buyers, etc. Always, always, always use Tor to sign up (preferably in Whonix) when creating the e-mail and only use Tor to check that e-mail. From here on in you should not be using any Wi-Fi networks associated to your personal identity. Coffee shops, open Wi-Fi networks, and soon later on in the next course when you learn how to hack Wi-Fi networks are the only networks you should be using to connect to the internet when performing "business" activities. Remember what you've learned from others and the articles you've already read. Learn from others for fucks sake.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you require a Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo! email address some of those email providers require a mobile number in order to sign up. Depending on what and why you require that type of email you'll be needing a mobile device to sign up with. Any provider that requests a mobile number you'll want to use a pre-paid cell phone (burner phone) that can receive texts. When it comes to purchasing a burner phone it's best to purchase it as far from your physical location as possible and ideally wait at least a month or so before activating/using it. This way hopefully the security footage of where you bought the burner phone from is already recorded over. In any event take efforts to disguise yourself when you're buying a burner phone (sunglasses, hats, wigs, etc.).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's best to stick with email providers that operate on Tor and use PGP when dealing with clients, buyers, associates, etc.

    Remember, it's not so much about the e-mail provider being safe as it is about being safe while using email to communicate with others.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Always connect to the email over Tor and use PGP as much as possible.
