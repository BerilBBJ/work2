    The more memory your computer has the better it will be because being able to run multiple VM's at once is very beneficial. When you run VM's you dedicated some RAM to those machines and operating smoothly is what everyone wants. Hard drive space is important too if you plan on having a multiple VM's as each can take up to 10GB each minimum.

    First off, the computer you plan on using for anything illegal should never connect to your home Wi-Fi network or any other network that can be associated to your real identity. Secondly, you should purchase your "work" laptop with cash and nothing else. Keep the laptop/computer you use for hacking, carding, or whatever you're doing away from anything personally related to you. This means no checking your personal Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, or any other accounts for any reason while you're using it. Never connect your laptop. computer, phone, or any other personal device to the network your dedicated "work" laptop is connected to. Keep it separate!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Your "work" computer should strictly be meant for "work" and "business". Period.

    Any laptop will do that is capable of running multiple Virtual Machines (VM) when needed which will vary in price from $400 - $3000 USD. Purchasing your "work" laptop/computer is up to personal preference so there's no one machine for all as it depends on what you need it for but you'll want something with high RAM (8GB+) if you plan on running multiple VMs. Some people use serious machines for their needs from Alienware laptops, gaming PC's, solid Linux machines, and everything in between but the point is your laptop/computer should suit your needs for what you plan on using it for. If you're planning on running multiple operating systems then you're going to need something with sufficient memory with a decent processor. You want it somewhat portable so keep that in mind but don't over think this too much as you'll soon find out reading through this course that you actually don't need a powerful machine depending on what you're doing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For example, I personally use Alienware machines &lt;17" because I prefer the hardware that they come with for other means like gaming, Photoshop, minor GPU WPA/WPA2/Password cracking, and other programs that require a more expensive robust machine when I'm not actively "hacking". My machine has nothing to do with hardware specifications for "hacking" per se but mostly for pleasure in my down time. There are times when I'm using the shittest netbook booting Tails from USB to log into a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with SSH that I've setup in Romania with all my hacking programs installed there. Then the next day using my laptop to use Kali in a VM to hack an art gallery Wi-Fi network and cause chaos. Everyone is different.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being a cyber elite hacker with 9000 shells loaded I wanted multiple VMs at my disposal so I needed a more powerful computer/laptop to do this flawlessly for me. As a hacker, if you're involved with a hack and you're waiting on an email reply from a target or a reverse shell to come back in real time either with Metasploit, Empire, or custom malware (specifically with macOS targets) you'll have some time to kill. I'd be bored as fuckkk waiting for this to happen so I'd be gaming on a wicked laptop while waiting for that shell to drop. Some god damn employees I'd be targeting wouldn't check their emails throughout the day so I needed to kill some time and Tails wasn't satisfying my needs. When buying your "work" laptop it should meet everything you like to use on a computer and be portable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're starting out in the cybercriminal/hacker world the biggest question you need to ask yourself is how do you want to operate? Do you want to use a computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux or do you want to use only virtual machines (VM) to conduct your dark web activities? Or do you want to boot directly from a USB stick for your shady ass business dealings?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The answer is different depending on what type of user you are (hacker, carder, vendor, buyer, forum lurker, etc.) and what you require from your computer. Using VMs and booting directly from a USB presents different problems and each have their weaknesses which we'll discuss so you can make an informed decision on what best suits your needs.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never use your host machine to connect directly to anything criminally related (running Tor, logging into your vendor account, checking emails, etc.). You should always use VMs as it's the safest thing you can do regardless of what your host operating system (OS) is whether that be Windows, macOS, or Linux. What that means is if you're using a Windows computer don't just download the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) and use the Tor browser directly from your computer to connect to a questionable website that you're a member of (fraud, hacking, drugs, etc.). You can use Windows, macOS, and Linux as your host computer but you should always be using a VM when it comes to hacking or anything wicked (illegal).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Before you go on hating on me continue on reading comrade.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll see my recommendations of what setup you should be using at the end of this chapter but for now I'd like you to read through everything to get a handle on the information so you're able to understand everything later on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Until you're fully operating at a high OPSec level and using multiple different Wi-Fi networks that you've hacked onto or you're on open networks %100 of the time you should be using a VM, always! Once you progress in your knowledge and understanding of everything we'll be talking about in this course you can then make the decision to stick with VMs or boot directly from USB. Until then, it's highly recommended that everything you do is done through a VM. The Whonix-Workstation VM specifically which you'll come to learn soon enough.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you've gone through the forums, read the threads, followed OPSec advice, been on IRC, or seen the cyber security news flyers around town then I'm sure you've heard of everyone recommending the Tails OS and how it's the greatest OS out there for anonymity. Every cyber criminal, ghost, ghoul, and their mothers should be using Tails or they're fuck tards that are compromising themselves and everything yada yada blah blah blah. Heard it all before. If you have been living under a rock and have no idea what Tails OS is then guess what!? It's time to Google it and have an understanding of it. Once you're familiar with Tails OS if you want you can then install it and see exactly how it functions.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    It's true Tails has some great features and makes it very easy for non-technical fuckers to get shit up and running quickly in order to browse the dark web anonymously. Tails is great because everything is routed through Tor automatically and has most commonly used applications setup for you. You got email, Tor browser, chat programs, PGP, etc. already setup for you pre-configured to be routed through the Tor network. Tails OS is a plug and play OS ready to go with an anonymous feature that securely deletes it's history after each shutdown which eliminates and hinders a law enforcement (LE) computer forensic investigation leaving no digital trace for them to follow, except the USB in your hand, and it's super easy to use now and days. You can store all your dark web activities (forum accounts, vendor accounts, PGP keys, email accounts, etc.) so when you boot into Tails everything is fresh again. Tails will wipe the RAM and leave no trace when you shutdown so your login items, PGP keys, etc. are still there when you boot it back up if you've installed persistence with an encrypted folder. If you've installed it onto a bootable USB then everything is on USB for easy access/carry and concealment. It's all wicked don't get me wrong. But...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're an average Joe or just want to buy some drugs or fuck around browsing the forums then you should install Tails on a USB with persistence and boot directly from it (instructions to follow). All you need is a laptop with 2G of ram and you're good to go. Don't get a crazy laptop for this as you're booting off the USB so it's going to be slower than normal but nothing unbearable. As for everyone else (hacker, vendor, fraudster, government insider, master spy, etc.) we need to take some more steps to ensure we're golden and our OPSec is bulletproof.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you install Tails in a VM then you're not given the option to setup persistence in order to keep your bookmarks, passwords, PGP keys, email accounts, etc. after each reboot and will have difficulty sharing anything from your host machine to the Tails VM. This is all great if you're just browsing the fuck around the dark web not checking your vendor email, hacker forums, saving your passwords, PGP keys, VPN/VPS credentials, etc. You only get that feature when you setup persistence and boot directly from a USB so by using Tails in a VM is pretty useless from a functionality perspective and not ideal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For the future hackers and crackers out there once you have your laptop it's important to familiarize yourself with the command line interface (CLI) or Terminal. You do not have to be an expert to use the CLI or Terminal but you should know the basic commands and what they do and when to use them. Having the basics down when using the command line or Terminal is ideal. If you do not know anything about Linux/Unix then now is a good time to learn it so purchase a Linux basic book or take an online course. YouTube has plenty of tutorials available for free as well. Take the time to learn Linux/Unix and feel somewhat familiar with it. You don't need to install Linux/Unix as your primary OS but you should download VirtualBox onto your computer and install a Linux distro of your choice. It's recommended to begin with an easier distro such as Ubuntu to learn the basics and get familiar with using the CLI or Terminal. Go to www.ubuntu.com and download the latest ISO version and begin to use it as an OS specifically focusing on the command line/terminal. VirtualBox is open source and free for download. The goal is to feel comfortable with the command line and have the basics down. I mean the basics! That means how to navigate through directories, open files, edit text files, and how to run scripts or programs. The basics dudes... Don't mess around with the GUI in Ubuntu but stick to the command line interface (CLI) and Terminal for learning purposes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're using macOS then use the Terminal.app for anything command line related as this is very similar to anything *nix related.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Figure out what works for you and use the foundations taught in this course to keep you safe regardless of whatever cyber criminal activities you get into but remember whatever you plan on doing you should never be using your host machine to directly do business with anything illegal/questionable. Use VMs! Never anything directly from your host machine. This is important.

      Hardening your OS
     </b>
    </p>
    Regardless of what your host machine is (Windows, macOS, or Linux) you should be doing everything in a VM and not using your host machine to run Tor directly, browse the dark web, store passwords or anything illegal/questionable, etc. I'll be repeating that over and over until you get the point. I'm not going to tell you which OS is better than the other because as you'll come to see it doesn't matter (it does a little though).

      Windows
     </b>
    </font>
    <br/>
    Window users are usually the main targets of hackers/LE as "most" users have Windows installed as their main OS. Windows has a large attack surface which presents many ways you can be compromised by malware. If you're insisting on using Windows then you need to encrypt your HD with BitLocker, use encrypted containers or encrypted USBs for your Virtual Machines(VM), and ideally have a VPN installed. If you're not a Windows user but require it to test your malware or tactics then download the free 90-day trial from Microsoft. You can install it, disable the time sync with your host machine, create a snapshot, and use it accordingly.
    <br/>

      Linux
     </b>
    </font>
    <br/>
    If you're just starting out with hacking I don't recommend installing Linux as your main OS unless you're very comfortable with it as your host machine. If you're just learning I do not recommend on using it as your host machine simply due to lack of experience so stick with what you know for now.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Never enter any personal information, login into personal accounts, connect to your own WiFi network, etc. As you go through this course you'll realize you're able to use Windows, macOS, or whatever you feel comfortable using as your host machine. I cannot stress enough that whatever OS you're using you need to be encrypting the HD, using VirtualBox/VMWare to conduct your dark web activities through VMs with a VPN installed on your host machine. This is what we're going to focus on.

    The link below will prevent macOS from phoning home to anything Apple related and other third parties which is something we want to avoid when using a macOS as your host machine.. You achieve this by creating a backup of your "/etc/hosts" file, delete the original, add the following script below to your new "/etc/hosts" file, and save the new "/etc/hosts" file.
    <br/>

    If you're using Tor on the network causing fucking mayhem but your macOS is making connections to your Apple iCloud that's probably not a great idea is it?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    By replacing your "/etc/hosts" file with the above script it will redirect all domains listed in the "/etc/hosts" file to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) so no connection is made from your machine to any Apple server.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can also do this in Windows by editing the "C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts" file.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    WARNING - replacing your "/etc/hosts" or "C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts" file will prevent your OS from properly updating your computer. It's recommended to visit a random coffee shop and replace the modified hosts file with the backup of the original to update as required when needed. You should always keep your host OS up to date and install the latest security fixes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Adding the Glasswire, opensnitch, or LittleSnitch programs will give you the ability to have full control over your computer and feel confident that your machine is indeed safe. Once you have Glasswire, opensnitch, or LittleSnitch installed any new outgoing connection can be intercepted and added to the new "hosts" file to block as needed. I recommend installing Glasswire, opensnitch, or LittleSnitch first then going to your local coffee shop and connecting to the network to see how many outgoing connections are intercepted and add each of those domains/IP's (besides the required networking protocols of course) to your new host file. In time you'll ensure the only outgoing connection from your laptop will be something you initiated. No surprises.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Invest into those programs to control what leaves and enters your machine. You won't be disappointed I can assure you.

    If you're having problems always Google and research your question as you'll find there are plenty of helpful forums, posts, and more out there that will answer your question(s). It's recommended to keep whatever logins, passwords, or sensitive information encrypted with the encryption of your choice either on USB, in a VM, or an encrypted container on your host machine that's proven to be effective in the current time of this writing. If the Windows (BitLocker), macOS (FireVault), or Linux (LUKS) encryption methods are broken expect that to make the news so don't be too paranoid on thinking their encryption is backdoored because this would make major news should it fall apart.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If police have seized your computer they will have your all your unencrypted and encrypted folders, files, and all your shit. Your only safety net is having everything encrypted and stored properly. The main goal here is plausible deniability and knowing that the encryption you used will stand up to current digital forensics and brute force attacks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If they have tracked you to your location and are now investigating, questioning, and interrogating you then it's up to your physical security to keep you out of harm's way. If you follow this course you'll know how to be a digital ghost so you won't have to even fucking worry about it. Or flip your shit after each marketplace take down, vendor arrest, etc. Whichever bro.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The harsh reality is you should always be doing your dark web activities or anything illegal through a VM on your host machine. *GASP*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want you to understand why so picture this. You're a vendor logged into your vendor account on a compromised darknet marketplace owned by police and a Tor Browser exploit is used against everyone connecting to that marketplace logged into their accounts. Right now as you're reading this your laptop is compromised and a network connection went from your laptop to the command and control (C&amp;C) server owned by the police. If that occurred they would know your IP, location, and are now closing in on you to make an arrest. Would you even know that you leaked your location or if any of that even happened?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If your computer sent data from your laptop to a remote server would you know? How would you? Would you notice anything different while using the Tor Browser on your Windows, macOS, or Linux computer? How about when you're using Tails or any other OS? Think about that for a second. All you're doing is blindly trusting the Tor project developers, Windows, macOS, Linux, Tails OS developers, etc. that everything is all good. You have no god damn idea if it's all good which is like %99.9 of all Tor users in my opinion. Everyone just trusts these programs are secure and blindly uses it for their illegal activities. Is everyone just crossing their fingers that all this shit is legit and performing illegal activities from their home networks while using personal emails to register for illegal shit? The answer is "YES", which is fucked. Blind trust is never a good idea.

    There are always exploits waiting for you and some you don't even know are possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A exploit for Tor Browser v8.5.2 was found being exploited in the wild on June 20, 2019 and an immediate critical patch was updated with Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) v8.5.3 being released. Exploits are found all the fucking time and to consider anything Tor, Tails, Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Whonix, Qubes, etc. to be somehow immune to exploits is fucking retarded. Stop being retarded and plan for everything to betray you :)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    More recently another exploit was found on March 13, 2020.

    The point I want to make is that we know 0-day exploits used against the tools we use to remain anonymous will be bad and have devastating consequences for us. If you're browsing your favorite dark market looking for some new cocaine to shovel right to your face and an exploit is used against the Tor browser that you're using while logged into your drug vendor/buyer account, guess what? Game over. You just showed them your real location while logged in to your vendor or buyer account. Congratulations.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Really think that over. If you've been compromised and you've leaked your IP or otherwise you wouldn't have a god damn clue whether it happened or not regardless if you're running Tails, Kali, Windows, macOS, or any other OS either directly booting from a USB or in a VM. The end result is the same. Your IP is leaked compromising you and getting you ready for jail. The point is you're just trusting the applications you're using won't turn against you. I just want to let that sit with you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is why we want to have full control over our computer and ensure every connection coming and going is initiated by us and our hard drives/USB are encrypted. In the next course (ACT I) of this hacking series you''ll learn how to hack other Wi-Fi networks around you so even if an exploit is used and your IP leaked it sure as shit won't be linked to you and you can continue on with your chaotic adventures not worried about it since you won't be using your own Wi-Fi network. For now, keep reading through this course and when you go through ACT I you can incorporate that into your OPSec to ensure maximum anonymity.

    Alright this chapter had a lot of information in it and hopefully you were able to understand all of it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To conclude I like to recommend a setup that will ensure your shit is legit while hacking the world or wanting to ensure you have the safest setup possible. All of these recommendations are meant for the typical dark web netizen and hackers alike.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Use whichever host you feel comfortable with whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux with either Glasswire, opensnitch, or Littlesnitch installed. It's an absolute must to be able to control what's coming and going from your host machine. Always ensure the OS is up to date with the updates installed, full HD encryption implemented, Anti-Virus or Windows Defender installed (for now but as a hacker AV is our nemesis when developing malware), and a VPN installed on your host machine. You will be using VMs for everything dark web/illegal related and should be kept on a USB that's encrypted or an encrypted container on your HD. We know how people are caught so we want to plan for worst case scenario and ensure our setup is robust.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When it comes to what OS you should be using in a VM the answer is Whonix.
    <br/>
    https://www.whonix.org
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Whonix is a desktop operating system designed for advanced security and privacy. Whonix mitigates the threat of common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity is realized via fail-safe, automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. A heavily reconfigured Debian base is run inside multiple virtual machines, providing a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP address leaks. Commonly used applications are pre-installed and safely pre-configured for immediate use. The user is not jeopardized by installing additional applications or personalizing the desktop. Whonix is under active development and is the only operating system designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whonix routes everything through Tor (like Tails) using a Whonix-Gateway VM and a Whonix-Workstation VM to do so. If you've heard of Tails and have used Tails before then Whonix will be very easy to setup and get running. I highly recommend encrypting a USB and putting the Whonix VMs onto it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First let's download and install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whonix is very easy to setup! Head over to https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/XFCE and download the OS in ISO format under step 1. Click on "Download Whonix XFCE" to download the VirtualBox VM (I recommend using VirtualBox).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
     <img height="300" src="../images0/19.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Once you've downloaded the Whonix OS double click the Whonix-XFCE-15.0.0.4.9.ova file and it will automatically load it into VirtualBox for you. Ignore all the details and click on "Import" and click on "Agree" twice when prompted. This might take a few minutes importing Whonix OS into VirtualBox.
    <center>
     <img height="300" src="../images0/20.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Whonix functions as a Workstation and Gateway. There will be (2) Whonix OS's to select from after you've imported the .ova file but you always want to launch the Gateway VM first, wait until that boots up and is complete, and then launch the Workstation VM after. All your activities will be done through the Whonix-Workstation VM and nothing is done in the Whonix-Gateway VM. The only time you'll be doing anything in the Whonix-Gateway VM is updating as prompted to do so.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ok let's start Whonix up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Select the Whonix-Gatway-XFCE in VirtualBox and click on "Start". Let it boot up automatically and click on "Understand" twice when prompted to do so then click on "Finish".
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
     <img height="175" src="../images0/21.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Select "Connect" and click "Next" and then "Next" again. This will setup Tor and ensure everything is routed through Tor from the Workstation to the Gateway.
    <center>
     <img height="575" src="../images0/22.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Once that's complete click "Finish" and let it run through it's Tor Testing and auto updates to ensure everything is setup.
    <br/>
    <center>
     <img height="575" src="../images0/68.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    This might take a few minutes. It will prompt a window to runa  command so let' open up Terminal and type:
    <br/>
    <font color="red">
     <b>
      sudo apt-get-update-plus dist-upgrade
     </b>
    </font>
    <center>
     <img height="575" src="../images0/69.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Minimize the Whonix-Gateway VM and leave it running in the background. Now go back to VirtualBox and Start the Whonix-Workstation-XFCE VM.
    <br/>
    <center>
     <img height="175" src="../images0/23.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Click the "Understood" buttons twice and then click finish. It will then check the Tor connection making sure everything is setup properly for you.
    <center>
     <img height="575" src="../images0/24.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    Again, you might be presented to run the same command in Terminal:
    <br/>
    <font color="red">
     <b>
      sudo apt-get-update-plus dist-upgrade
     </b>
    </font>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After that you're good to go and now Whonix is setup to ensure everything you do on the Workstation not only gets routed through Tor but to a different VM entirely first. Think about the exploits needed to compromise you and expose you with this setup! This is the safest method when it comes to anything dark web related. This setup is very robust and adding everything else we'll be talking about in regards to your host machine you can now feel very comfortable with your OPSec.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Click on the bottom left blue icon and then click on "Web Browser". You'll want to run that first as it'll most likely need to download the latest Tor Browser updates.
    <center>
     <img height="500" src="../images0/25.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll see clicking on the icon beside the URL button on the right hand side that an update is downloading and when complete click to restart Tor browser. No different than using the Tor Browser you're using now. You'll want to run that first as it'll most likely need to download the latest Tor Browser updates.
    <center>
     <img height="500" src="../images0/70.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you see the screen below you're good to go. I recommend on taking a snapshot of a fresh install in case you fuck things up ;)
    <center>
     <img height="500" src="../images0/71.png" width="700"/>
     <br/>
    </center>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I won't go into a full tutorial on Whonix but I suggest you familiarize yourself with it before fully committing to it. Create PGP test keys, emails, etc. before committing to a full dark web handle to see how it functions and re-install it when you're ready to switch over. As always ensure you backup your important files (PGP keys, passwords, etc.) should something occur to the VM.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the best setup because it will require multiple different 0-day exploits needed to compromise you AND you've learned about hardening your OS in order to give you full control over what leaves your host computer. I cannot stress enough you want to install Glasswire, opensnitch, or Littlesnitch to prevent any unwanted connections from your computer and to control any network traffic to and from that machine. You'll be operating strictly from a VM preferably saved to a USB that you'll also be encrypting.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you want to use your OS that you're comfortable with then it's important to harden your OS, save everything to USB that's encrypted, and use a VPN on your host machine. This should be the minimum.
