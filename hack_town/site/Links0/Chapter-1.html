     Introduction
    </p>
    This course was written by me, Funshine. Who the fuck I am? I was a freelance Blackhat, nation state contractor, dark web phisher, spoofer, forum lurking master, ex-associate (ish) at well-known hacking firm, who made a lot of money through my cybercrime career. Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal, I've hung up my black hat and retired filling my time to create high quality cybercriminal courses for the people who take the time to find and read them. I'm creating courses from my experience that you can duplicate and launch on your own to be profitable as I was.

    First off there is no one way of doing things. These courses are not the word of law when it comes to cyber crime but this is from my perspective so if you have something to add, have a better way of explaining things, or anything you think that I don't know that pertains to the topics in these courses send me a god damn email and let me know what is WAT. That way we can keep it all updated for everyone to enjoy and cause a fuck show in their hometowns. HackTown will arm you with the right information on cyber warfare which is exactly what you're wanting to learn. Good job my friend you found this place.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This course is meant for the "average" individual who wants more information on remaining hidden and staying anonymous while online so they can begin their career in cybercrime safely. Hopefully you take away many useful points that you're able to incorporate into your daily OPSec activities.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Relevant cybercriminal information is scattered across the web and going through all that reading, researching, testing, etc. will take years. Literally years. I've put it all together for you in a series of guides/courses that will help level up your knowledge to the level of script kiddie king right up to an intermediate hacker.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's assumed you have general knowledge of hacker techniques, lingo, interests, and terminology that is used in this course. This document has been reviewed however there may be some language and grammatical errors as translation sometimes get misunderstand. If you come across errors (spelling or grammar) or have more information that you think can be added please let me know.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You'll understand how people are caught and how you will be too if you're not careful. You may be a complete noob, novice, or a relatively experienced hacker man but the reality is that everyone starts somewhere and starting out can be the most confusing experience when trying to learn something new. There's never one way of doing something but hopefully this develops your critical thinking and knowledge surrounding such activities and enhances your skill sets. If you want to be a better blackhat it's good to have the academics behind you, professional IT experience, computer security knowledge, and current credentials (CISSP. OSCP, CEH, GIAC, A+, etc.) to greatly improve your skills. Both work hand and hand.

    The people I've worked with have numerous years in many different fields which has saved our asses from time to time on both sides of the fence. As you progress in your career you'll see why and understand that keeping in the know will help you in your future endeavors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's important to remain anonymous, blend in, and be very difficult, if not impossible to track while online. Hackers, crackers, carders and the like are quite good at this as it's vital to their freedom and financial success. Unfortunately for you in the beginning when you're learning to master this trade you're bound to make mistakes and be misguided. In this industry you need to practice in order to perfect, sharpen, and hone your skills. Going to jail or being charged with a criminal offence can and will ruin your career goals and your life as you know it so it's best to research the laws in your country to get a handle on the charges that will be laid against you should you make that "mistake". Don't blindly break laws.

    By learning how others have been caught, captured, and arrested can help you avoid the same fate. It's important to follow the news, Twitter, Facebook, or whatever social media you use to follow hackers, IT security consultants, whitehats, and everything in between related to IT cyber security. Follow, listen, read, and observe. The quieter you are the more you'll be able to hear as you'll soon come to realize. Being involved this way will help educate you on how other hackers and cybercriminals are caught, the logistics of major hacks, new malware techniques, and the newest cyber-attacks out there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Today there are a lot of "security researchers" out there trying to make a name for themselves and they will literally make public all the new exploits, 0-day's, code, tools, and everything in between that makes your life a heck of a lot easier. You don't even need to rely on finding your own 0-day exploit any longer because some security researcher will release it for free and give it to you! In fact it's quite frustrating finding out someone has revealed a "new" vulnerability that you've been using the whole time that is now patched and over used. However, it's definitely taken some of the leg work out of doing it yourself so there are pros and cons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Lastly, this course does not include EVERYTHING for you. Honestly how could it? It's expected that you're capable of doing some research on your own as well with the new knowledge you'll gain by reading this. These teachings will show you how to stay and remain hidden, but you cannot be expected to be spoon fed with hand holding along the way. Google and YouTube are your friend when you're stuck on something so any question, problem, or error paste it directly into Google and read through forums, blogs, etc. until you find your answer. If you're not capable of this then please stop now before you hurt yourself. You may think this is a cop out but most, if not all, of your questions can be answered this way and realistically the amount of questions you'll have will be vast so it's best to get efficient in searching and finding your answers on your own.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Being able to effectively search, read, learn, and find your answer is a skill on its own so be prepared to be somewhat self-sufficient when going through these courses. YouTube has a large number of videos that can walk you through your problem, literally, at the basic level. Having trouble installing VMware or VirtualBox? Having trouble getting dnsspoof to work? Google it or use YouTube. Use the internet to your advantage without compromising yourself and begin to become self-sufficient. Most people who are good at hacking, carding, etc. have learned step by step from books, others, whatever means they needed to so treat this knowledge like a University or College course and do some homework and read, read, and read some more. If you have major problems following this course and cannot replicate the teachings then what you're attempting to do and learn is way beyond your capabilities and you should stop what you're doing, accept your fate, and focus on something easier such as cabinet making, cake baking, or watching the world pass you by.
