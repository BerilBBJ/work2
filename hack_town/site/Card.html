   Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal for numbers of years I've opted into creating high quality courses for the people who can afford them. I'll share my knowledge for anyone who is able to put some money on the table to get up to date hacking information. At the time of this writing this has only been sold to a few but now I'd like to open it up to the many. I can't sell my book at Waterstones so here we are.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course is good for:
   <br/>
   - Carders
   <br/>
   - Fraudsters
   <br/>
   - All the information surrounding credit card fraud your mind can handle
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You'll learn from real world examples and from other carders history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course isn't for everyone and is not designed to hold your hand all the way through. It does include resources, articles, and links that you should read, understand, and be able to apply the knowledge learned in order to be successful and to maximize this course.
