      Believe it or not there are different levels of being a carder once you get your footing with all of this. We all have our own methods, opportunities, and ideas that lead us to success. We'll discuss these carder levels but please note this is just a simple generalization so you're able to see the differences in carding levels. I want you to understand where you want to take this AND whether or not this is even possible for you.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Consider anything to do with credit card fraud to be broken down in (5) levels excluding mobile carding. Depending on your goals and abilities will dictate which level of carder level you fall in. We'll get into the levels shortly.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Levels 1 -3 get more difficult as you level up through them but once you realize how fucking stupid those level of carders are you'll begin to see that levels 4-5 are much easier and more profitable. We're going to talk about carder level 1-3 first and then get into the juicy shit but before we do I want to say something about people who are aiming to be a carder level 1-3. Ready? FUCK THAT!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Don't fucking aim to be a level 1-3 carder ever because it's bullshit and you'll waste your fucking time on doing that. The easiest way to be successful with online carding is mobile carding. I'll let that sink in while you're reading this portion but anything to do with using a stolen CC online and ordering items from a website can fuck right off seriously. No joke. I'll push everyone who's reading this course to where you should strive to be. This is the secret sauce we're going to get into. This course is not just about educating and getting you up to speed with being a credit card fraud master but this course is also designed in a way to make you think differently about credit card fraud. I'm hoping to give you those Aha! moments that lead you to success so you're able to get an escort every night and do as much cocaine as your face can handle. My friends stay with me and you'll realize carding levels 4-5 is where the big boys are. Truth be told being a level 4-5 carder is much easier than anything else along with mobile carding. Different risks of course.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Remember my friend in Portland that taught me the credit card fraud ways? That fucker let me try all his "special methods" for the first 2-3 days when using stolen CCs and showed me how difficult that shit actually was. I ordered a bunch of shit to a drop address and then had to sell it to other people to make money. Pretty fucking annoying and had a lot of moving parts I didn't like. Turns out the best method was to create a website or eBay account that sells whatever products you plan on carding so that people make the purchase first and then you card the item right to them. Even that becomes unmanageable. eBay, craigslist, second hand websites, etc. all became very important in moving stolen goods and became more work than I expected. Wasn't for me.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I wasted my fucking time doing all that which I'm sure some of you have wasted your time with those methods as well. It wasn't until roughly half way through of hanging out with him that he told me the real deal with credit card fraud. He wanted me to see the beginnings of CC fraud in order to open my mind up and change my outlook on this shit. It opened my eyes and blew my fucking brain which sent me on a cybercriminal fucking spree across the world like a fucking maniac. This is what I'm trying to do with everyone reading this in order to show you the right way with credit card fraud. Alright let's break it down.

       Level 1 carder:
       <font color="green">
        Easy
       </font>
      </h4>
      This is easy time and is a good place to start out if you're homeless learning carding basics. This level of carding is for people who want to order pizza, small orders for food over the phone from restaurants, and very minor shit. Teenage level things you see? If you're planning on being a level 1 carder then you can go ahead and order Chinese food with the CC details you have acquired. Pretty straight forward you broke bastard. If you're able to make an online order for food with basic CC details then you're within reach of the level 1 carder. This is minor shit and really is pretty stupid if you're learning carding in order to do that. It's just as simple as taking your friends CC from their wallet and placing an order to your local pizza shop over the phone so you can eat that pepperoni pizza like a boss. Congratulations you've made it man!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>
       Level 1 carders need to obtain:
      </b>
      <li>
       Credit Card Number (CC)
      </li>
      <li>
       Expiration Date on the card

       Level 2 carder:
       <font color="orange">
        Intermediate
       </font>
      </h4>
      This is the level most people jump into when starting off with carding which is another good starting point for new commers to credit card fraud. If you're planning on being a level 2 carder you're aiming to card items that are mostly under $500 USD and are from smaller businesses online. These websites should be unique and not well known when being selected to card on while avoiding VBV. I'd recommend on getting into the mindset of thinking locally about which small businesses in your area may have an online merchant shop. You want to card on low level targets (clothing stores, shoe stores, etc.) so start thinking what you consider to be a lower level target. These orders are all done online with stolen CCs.

      Level 3 carders are experienced individuals who have a great understanding of carding online and have a method they've determined to be viable when ordering items online. This would be for online orders from any major retailor for higher value items such as electronics, laptops, small appliances, etc. and have acquired the details to get around VBV bullshit.

      Level 3 carders are where everyone thinks they want to be and is that typical image in your head when you're thinking of "carding". Right? This is what everyone thinks about when they hear credit card fraud. They think about someone obtaining stolen CC details which were stolen from whatever website, CC details sold on the marketplaces, and someone else used the details to order a laptop to an address in the Bronx. Right? This is what everyone probably thinks and wants to strive to be. Which is fucking wrong and probably not going to happen with ease.

      The main problem when level 3 carding is you're making purchases online that are usually of higher value which means those websites, businesses, online merchants, etc. will have VBV waiting for you when you click "Checkout".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I realized when I was a "level 3 carder" that ordering items online takes
      <b>
       <u>
        A LOT
       </u>
      </b>
      of trial and error that comes with failure around every fucking corner. Lots of time spent on buying the right cards, ordering online, orders cancelled, drops being burned, requiring ID to pick up the item, etc.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Level 3 carders usually get very frustrated and end up abandoning the craft even if you have a few successes. After doing this a few times you begin to see the amount of moving parts to this type of CC fraud and the amount of work involved. Ordering shit online with a stolen credit card isn't as easy as it once was. Those times are long gone. Not completely gone per se but they are to some degree. If you go down this route you'll need a drop address for your goods to get shipped to and then of course you still need to sell this shit yourself to get DAT MONEY. Depending on your age and intelligence this might sound pretty sweet to you, maybe.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I'm not saying you can't make money carding at this level but I'm just saying the amount of time you'll spend on whatever bullshit carding operation you want to get going can be better spent on actually making money. If you're committing that type of credit card fraud why aim for the lowest level of a credit card fraudster? Are you the type of criminal that robs a gas station instead of something actually worth it like a bank? What are you doing man?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Most of us all think that once we get into carding we're going to make all this cash dollarz but you soon realize that ordering items online with a stolen credit card, getting them shipped successfully to a drop, and then re-selling that item isn't going to be a way of doing that. There are a lot of moving parts that are difficult to lock down and make work in your favour in this type of fraud. I'm not even going to go into any more detail with this level of carding because you should be thinking much higher than this.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Honestly, unless you're a teenager or have an opportunity to easily commit this type of fraud just understand that yes people do it and know how they do it but I wouldn't spend too much time on this shit if you want to make a career out of fraud. Sure people might be making a bit of money here and there but it's an operation just like anything else which requires time on task. Use your time wisely my friends. Seriously though fuck level 3 carding.

      </h4>
      Level 4 carders are the individuals who clone people's credit cards, walk into a store like a savage, make a purchase in person, and walk the fuck right out of there. At a later time they either sell the item online or keep it for themselves but these items are of high value. This is a generalization of this type of carder as you'll some come to learn there are many variations with a level 4 carder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Level 4 carders are the types of carders that usually are more mature, older in age (&gt;25), knowledgeable with fraud, and have life experience behind them. These individuals are that type of demographic because they have a better understanding of what's needed in order to be a successful level 4 carder, or any serious fraudster for that matter. Level 4 carders are going to be "acting" to some degree, have good social skills, and are excellent social engineers. Like any level of carding you'll need to develop your own method but developing your own method is fairly trivial once you have an understanding of how to card at this level. When you're done this course you'll have a greater understanding of how to create your own methods and just how simple that actually is. Don't buy anyone else's method from the interscams. Fuck that. Create your own. If you don't create your own you will never succeed with where you want to take this. You can count on that. You can create your own. Trust me you can.

      Anything that involves you personally being in a location that will have cameras, witnesses, and basically every IoT device recording your face while you're committing a crime and sending it back to mother Russia for analysis tends to bring with it much more risk. I think we all can agree that committing crimes over the internet is much different then committing crimes IRL yes? ClearView AI shattered my mentality what can I say.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So if you're 12 and reading this fraud course then I'm afraid you have limits in what you're capable of doing which means, for now, you're stuck in the level 1-3 carder level. Don't stress though because you're probably going to learn a fuck ton by reading this which will help educate you on how to be a professional in the credit card fraud realm as you become an adult. Good for you.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Even if you're a level 3 carder and you're reading this we both know how annoying being a level 3 carder is. Sure' at first you think shit is gonna work out but then you realize the risk involved, the drops, pickups, re-sells, all that shit is shit. I'm sure we all have different experiences but to me it wasn't worth the risk in what I was doing and the amount of time I was dedicating to my carding operation for the profits just wasn't making sense. I was on average making $1000 - $3000 USD every few months give or take. Honestly, I was better than that. I had bigger hopes and dreams but it was good being there because it helped with solidifying my fraud mentality and being able to understand things a little more.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Ok time to rant dudes. The point of this rant is to make you think a little outside of the box which will help you understand how to develop your own carding methods with
      <b>
       anything
      </b>
      fraud related. Specially after you educate yourself and mature by reading this course.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Here's one of the many examples of how to change your mindset and think about carding METHODS. Let's dive deep baby.
      <br/>

      Here's what I mean. In the past I remember this pivotal moment in my cybercriminal career. Actually, being interviewed for this fucking carding course with Funshine triggered a memory back in the day for me which made me realize it was a very crucial learning point in my fraud career I must say. This aha! moment triggered a cascade of events that made me a lot of money really fucking quick. No need for applause I lost most of it and everything that mattered to me so no need for clapping you can sit down friends.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This was one of my first "test" methods when I graduated into a level 4 carder. I like to travel. So when you're travelling you get to see how different bars, restaurants, shops, keeps, castles, bunkers, dens, lairs, and stores operate around the world. Many are different and handle credit card transactions differently depending on their business model. I noticed at a few places I would frequent they would ask to physically hold onto my credit card when I dined at their restaurant, bar, club, etc. I began to keep track of these places and tried to find more that would operate in this manner. I kept a list of multiple places that operated this way in specific locations I would travel through and used that knowledge to go on my first ever carding spree.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I used:
      <li>
       Blank cards/PVC cards with chips in them
      </li>
      <li>
       Credit card/I.D printer
      </li>
      <li>
       Embossing machine
      </li>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I didn't have a CC number, EXP date, CVV, or proper name. I just had the ability to make a fake CC look like a real one. That's it. I even printed my real name on the printed CC just in case I was asked for ID. When I travelled to areas that were frequented by hundreds if not thousands of tourists daily I would only eat, drink, and party at these specific locations that would hold my CC. These places were la de da and I had to dress the part but these locations just wanted to physically "hold" my credit card while I was in their establishment and settle up after I was done. Nothing too crazy right? Pretty straight forward. The demographic that came to these types of places wasn't the one of the scamming type you see? False trust they had in their clientele but good for someone like me.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      At first it sounded pretty stupid for me to commit this type of fraud but then I thought if I only did these methods when appropriate I could spend more money on my accommodations when I travelled through these countries. I looked at it from a point of view that I'd save on spending money on drinking my dick off, eating, drugs, billiards, dancing, etc. Understand?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Instead of spending $1000 euro that week or so on entertainment I'd spend the $1000 euro on better hotel rooms and luxury living. I did that type of carding for the week I was in those locations and had that taste of having hotels rooms that were wayyyy beyond my league and I thought to myself fuck me I need to think how to do this better and keep this going. Again, I thought to myself I'm better than this. Aren't you?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I know that story probably isn't that interesting to most but the point is it made me realize that credit card fraud at certain levels all depends on the risk you're willing to take, whether there's an opportunity to commit fraud, the knowledge you have in that "method", and the planning and execution of your scheme. For me this scheme was of low risk since I knew how most of the establishments I planned on carding operated and since I don't look like a thug or homeless person I didn't encounter any real problems. I dressed the part, I acted the part, and when the time was right, I went to the bathroom or went outside for a smoke break and simply left. I just walked the fuck down the street and continued on with my night. They kept my printed credit card and I gave zero fucks. It felt awesome.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Let's take another look at one of the same articles you read earlier on in this chapter. Search for "The cards had the scammer’s names on them" and read that sentence.

      They did exactly what I was doing but on a more sophisticated level. I hope the wheels in your heads are beginning to turn :)
      <br/>
      <br/>
      What about the cameras man! Fuck that mans! Like I'm going back to those countries anyways fuck if I care. Yes of course it was risky but how far do you think those investigations went into tracking me down? Maybe they have a photo of me so they have a photo and description? Did they send my photo out around the world? No they didn't. Maybe locally I made the news but it's not going far. I was OK with the risks involved and it made me think differently about selecting my targets to commit fraud against. Up until ClearView AI and other companies started to make it super easy to identify a suspect from a still image. Fuck man. Just fuck.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Anyways, that was my moment of thinking differently with carding. I realized developing profitable methods starts of just like this. Figuring out better methods then just bars, restaurants, clubs, dancing, etc. and turning it into better profits. As stupid as it sounds what I just talked about is actually a carding "method". Right? Maybe you can think of places that do this and maybe where you live that isn't the "norm". Either way start to think outside of the box of what's possible for you in your area.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      People are always looking for new carding methods and are blinded easily. Looking for cashout method for PayPal, looking for cashout method for amazon, Hey! does anyone have a cashout method for Apple need fullz lol. Right? There are a lot of PayPal cashout guides, fraud amazon guides, private method %100 fraud guides, and every other %100 working no joke PayPal to bank card cashout guides only for $400! Yes? You've seem them. They are everywhere.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      By looking for those types of guides you're hoping that someone is going to sell you something that you can then turn around and make kazillions of dollars! Would you like to buy my "gold" beans for $1000 sir?! Come on now. You don't need anyone else's methods that's for sure. The only person you need in order to develop a very profitable method is yourself. HackTown is about investing into yourself and educating you in the realm of cybercrime from my experience which was profitable. Tad on the illegal side I guess but fuck man do whatever YOU think is best.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      You probably realized while reading about my first level 4 carding experience that I just printed fake information on a CC and didn't atually clone anyone else's credit card or anything. I just made the fake CC I printed on appear to be an actual credit card physically and the places I went to simply held the physical credit card thinking it was some sort of collateral. Why would anyone skip out on the bill if we have their credit card mentality right? It was my light bulb moment on how to create my own methods. In order to develop my own profitable methods I knew needed to know a little more about the places I was targeting and how they operated...
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Alright rant is over. Let's get back on track.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      A level 4 carder requires obtaining "DUMPS", writing the track 1 and 2 data to a blank CC, and using that CC in person to make a purchase. Right away you're probably thinking WTF man that shit isn't possible where I live! Cool story bro. Right? CHIP and PIN credit cards have killed this right? Wrong. Truthfully this depends greatly on the merchant in question and your geographical location in the world. In my experience stores that have a lot of foot traffic,
      <b>
       <u>
        tourists
       </u>
      </b>
      , people, etc. tend to have more relaxed policies when it comes to processing credit card transactions. Those types of businesses literally deal with so many CC providers, CC cards, etc. it can be different for every transaction.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Before we move forward, we need to focus on some things that you must learn when aiming to be a level 4 carder. First, you're going to need to be able to purchase DUMPS that contain track 1 and 2 data from whatever source you plan on purchasing them from. Let's talk about DUMPS in details.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      DUMPS are the data that skimmers have captured from someone's credit card when they've swiped it somewhere to make a purchase with it. A DUMP is an electronic copy of the magnetic stripe data of a credit card. DUMPS are the raw information collected from the credit card magnetic stripes which are stolen via skimming, a point-of-sale device infected with malware, or from some sort of data breach.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Instead of me explaining all of this I'm going to refer you to the link below.

      Magnetic stripes on payment cards, sometimes called magstripes, are divided into (3) tracks of data which are encoded directly onto the magstripe. Only Track 1 and Track 2 are actively used in payment card processing whereas Track 3 is rarely used and may not always be present on a card.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Both Track 1 and Track 2 contain enough basic information for processing payment card swipes by merchants. Most card readers will be able to read both Track 1 and Track 2 data, in case one of the tracks has become unreadable. You've already read from an article in the beginning of this course about how Track 1 and 2 data are displayed when it's captured from a card reader and being sold on the marketplaces. There are a lot of characters and random letters/numbers you noticed yes? Let's take a deeper look into all of this.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <font color="blue">

      As a level 4 carder you're purchasing CCV DUMPS, encoding them yourself onto a blank CC, printing the proper images of the right bank/CC onto the blank CC to blend in while using it, and using it at stores to purchase items.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>
       OR
      </b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      You have someone who works in an industry that is capable of swiping customers credit cards with their own little hand held card reader. There are many ways to obtain the CC details needed to function as a level 4 carder.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Some people might be thinking "I know someone who works at a restaurant that could use a little card reader and swipe all the customers data!". Right? Then you don't need to purchase any DUMPS or rely on anyone else! Yes! Wait, fuck no!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The problem obtaining CCs that way is when people report the fraud it would be trivial to determine if those people were at a single point that could link where the cards are being skimmed. This actually does happen so be very cautious when swiping peoples cards yourselves and not using them all from one place. You'll bring some heat faster than you know it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      OK. Back to mindset talk. Having more life experience behind you teaches you that when making real purchases with your own CC sometimes things don't go exactly how they're supposed to go when making a transaction. Think about how you would use your CC when walking into a store. You don't just fucking fly in with dark sunglasses and a hoodie on trying to make a purchase with a blank CC card right? Of fucking course not. Hopefully not.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My other aha! moment with credit card fraud was when I had a CC from TD Bank which had a chip and required a PIN when making purchases in person. However, over the years the chip appeared to be visibly worn down from general use and from me constantly taking it out of my wallet and putting it back in again. Eventually my credit card just stopped working one day when I went to pay for something that was just over $700 USD (auto repairs) and my CC kept coming up with an error which the clerk wasn't sure about. I explained the situation to the clerk and that my working theory as to why my credit card was all fucked up was the chip on the credit card had been worn down which had been causing me issues when using my card. Before I knew it the clerk was swiping the card at the POS instead and I was being presented with a receipt for me to sign. After that I thought holy fuck man another CC method I can leverage potentially. Another trigger for me when it comes to creating your own carding methods. This place accepted my credit card but it didn't work in the POS since the chip was damaged so they ended up swiping it. That was it. Again, simple shit but it made me realize it's all about opportunity being a level 4 carder and what I'm willing to pull off. Won't shit in my backyard but I'll take a flgiht somewhere and card like a fucking kamikaze.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We're assuming all CCs these days are, or will be, CIP and PIN so we're gonna focus on updated shit. Also, most people use that "tap" feature on their CC but for anything over $100 USD this feature isn't allowed. Why $100 limit? You guessed it. To prevent fraud.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Think of your own CC and how you make purchases with it at a store. Picture it in your mind. You're at a store making a purchase so you present your CC to the clerk, the clerk gives you the Point Of Sale (POS) machine, then you put your CC in the machine and enter your PIN. All good? Daily life right?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Now it's time to begin to think of what is realistic for you and what you're capable of doing. This is very important because if you're going to be successful not only does it depend on you getting around anti-fraud protections but it also depends on some key personal features such as:
      <li>
       How old you are.
      </li>
      <li>
       Your social skills or social engineering abilities.
      </li>
      <li>
       Your physical appearance, demeanor, maturity levels, and mannerisms are important.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you're tweaking from a meth binge don't go in to a store thinking you look "fine". You don't.
      </li>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Everyone thinks that CC fraud usually it just for online items. This isn't actually the case. I think it's important to know what you're capable of and what you're wanting to do with carding. We all want to make the money out of our asses but depending on your situation, where you live, your intelligence, etc. you might not be capable of some of these things.
      <br/>

      Mobile carding is by far the easiest method to use when performing carding online and requires little setup to get your operation going. You still require valid CC details when making online purchases but can negate the fact you need VPN, RDP, socks, VMs, cleaners, etc.

      By using a mobile device you're coming from that geographical area and thus if you make the right purchases of CCs you don't require all whole setup.

      Before we go into any more details about mobile carding, level 4, and level 5 carder, we must unfortunately take a break.

      I realized that when I was creating these hacking and fraud courses that people have many questions, expect excellent quality, and want the proper resources in order to be successful (vendors, tools, resources, etc.). That means access to the right tools whether that's purchasing stolen credit card information right through to purchasing ransomware for your money making campaigns. I realized I cannot do what I've planned on other forums&amp;, marketplaces, or other various circles I run in. It's too difficult to manage and keeping everything up to date with proper resources to make purchases from is time consuming. On top of that other forums go down, information gets lost, thread gets shutdown, etc. Around and around we go and it' annoying.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I decided to make a cybercriminal platform that will house all "useful" information surrounding hacking and fraud meant for people of all skill levels. Reality is unless you have no clue where to purchase CCs or have no idea on how to create your own carding methods then joining HackTown will help you. If you feel confident on where to purchase the right items and confident in moving forward you probably can be successful on your own.  If you want all the information along with the places to make the proper purchases needed to be successful then join up! HackTown isn't just about credit card fraud but has many courses from my experience as a success cybercriminal I think many people can still make money like I did.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This is an excellent opportunity to level up your knowledge and focus on giving yourself the skills needed to be successful in cybercrime. Joining HackTown will give you the full carding course which includes the equipment required along with proper links to make the purchases.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I've decided to branch out and turn HackTown into a new cybercriminal platform that will contain detailed hacking and fraud courses, items for sale, experienced and knowledgeable staff to assist you with whatever questions you may have surrounding the courses released at HackTown. No random topics besides the courses released will be in the forums. Very specific information.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I've been out of the game for a bit enjoying my retirement from my cybercriminal efforts and all I see is complete bullshit these days on the dark web surrounding proper information and reputable people. This is why HackTown is here. Real shit so stop spending hundreds of dollars on bullshit guides and terrible products. HackTown is created for the intermediate level of cybercriminal out there who's looking for the right information and gear to get shit done. All the courses at HackTown are based on my experience as a cybercriminal. When you're wanting more specific cybercriminal knowledge and are willing to take that next step HackTown will be there for you.
