       Why do people sell CCs?

     </h2>

    When I first started in fraud I would always think to myself why the fuck are these people selling stolen credit card information and not using it for themselves?! Well it came pretty clear once I started rolling in different hacker circles and hearing their inputs on the matter.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People specialize in different things, and that goes for criminals too. Some hackers are able to compromise a website and instead of defacing the website with some bullshit Iranian political bullshit they install a JavaScript Skimmer to the checkout portion of the website and capture a fuck ton of CCs.

    The point is once you start to get an absurd amount of CCs in your possession it's just too many to manage so most people branch out and begin to sell them. There's nothing wrong with that but you want to get fresh data and make the right connections with the sellers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All hackers and fraudsters have their hands in so many honey jars trying to make the most money. A hacker who compromises a company and steals 5,000 credit card numbers doesn't have the time or desire to use them all. At the same time, there are organized groups who specialize in buying stolen credit cards and making money from them, but lack the skills to hack a company to get their own. It's a beautiful supply chain just like any other business.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also, people live in different places all over the world so if I've hacked a company in the US and have a bunch of American credit cards I can't really use them in my area so I might opt to sell them instead.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everyone is selling whatever they're able to in order to maximize their income. It's much easier to sell the stolen credit card data you have at a fixed amount and move onto your next hack then it is to use them yourself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It all depends where you are in the supply chain which will dictate what you do with that type of data but most opt to sell. When buying CCs you want to purchase them from reputable places and people. Once you've purchase them you should use them ASAP. Do not buy them and sit on them for weeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Having a proper source for your CC's is obviously crucial to success. Links to proper sellers and reputable vendors can be found in Chapter 7 for HackTown members.
