    There are so many reasons as to why your carding efforts are failing. Let's touch on some of the more common reasons.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're using a stolen credit card don't go overboard and start carding multiple websites or places at the same time with the same card. Pick the target and use the CC once and move on but make sure the purchase is worth it for you. There's no point of carding like a fucking maniac when all your orders haven't shipped because you'll just end up burning the CC. Making an order go through and having it get approved is sometimes the easy part whereas getting the item shipped to where you want it to be delivered can be a whole other problem.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Credit card companies user their own proprietary technologies that look for anomalies in card holder's spending habits and online behaviours. These companies might be using 100+ data points to determining the likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent or not. If everything doesn't add up on their end then your shit will be declined, CC holder contacted from their financial institution, and CC burned.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything you've learned about in Chapter 3 will contribute to your failures. This plus the fact that you have no idea the CC information you're purchasing is valid or new. Right? Unless you're obtaining your own CCs you're relying on others to sell you proper information. Which may be fresh stolen CCs or old as fuck from last year trash ones. Just like drugs the better quality is closer to the top of the supply chain. Move up the ladder brothers.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You're going to want to refer to Chapter 3 regarding all the anti-fraud mechanisms in place as you should be aware there are so many reasons why your CCs aren't working or being burned. Without knowing truly the ins and outs of what you're trying to card you can associate failures to one, if not all, of those anti-fraud mechanisms talked about.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Remember, everyone wants to say they have a great supplier of CCs but unless you're obtaining them yourself you truly don't know if the vendor you're buying from is re-selling the cards, are the CCs fresh, has the organization where the Vendor is getting the CCs from been notified of a breach and is now going through each customer to notify them to cancel their cards?!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's all good when you're buying stolen CCs but if you're buying them from a breach that happened a year ago then you're not going to be successful. CC suppliers matter.
