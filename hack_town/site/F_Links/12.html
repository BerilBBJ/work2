       , compromising over a billion records. The vast majority of that fraud happened within United States borders. 47% of cross-border fraud happened from the U.S. too, and experts blame it on America’s slow adoption of EMV chip cards.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       When the UK deployed credit card chip technology, their counterfeit fraud rates declined by 70%. Now that the U.S. has, at last, made the transition, those statistics will topple locally, too.

       What is EMV?
      </h2>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the credit card behemoths who dominate the sector and developed the global standard for chip-based security. EMV has come to represent every credit card with chip, even those issued by smaller companies.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Because the chips generate a new number for every transaction, they make counterfeiting almost impossible. The card is inserted into instead of swiped through a
       <a class="css-8g5kq3 e1fc0pe10" href="hxxps://sumup.com/credit-card-reader/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip" id="">

       </a>
       , and a signature completes the purchase.

       Who Pays for Fraud?
      </h2>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The transition to EMV chip cards is good news if you have the technology to process them, but dire news if you’re still dragging your heels. Two years ago, retailers didn’t have to cover the counterfeit security breach tab, but now you do. The only insurance against liability is to offer your clients EMV technology.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The liability shift began late in 2015 to encourage retailers to adopt safer practices. At the time, the retail community complained bitterly to the National Retail Federation about the expense of upgrading to new card readers, but you needn’t pay a cent in upfront or fixed costs.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       Your typical EMV reader costs between $500 and $1000, alongside monthly and transaction fees. In comparison,
       <a class="css-8g5kq3 e1fc0pe10" href="hxxps://sumup.com/air-emv-terminal/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=emv-credit-card-chip" id="">

        They don’t demand upfront or monthly fees
       </a>
       , so switching for security purposes should be a no-brainer.

       EMV — Faster Than Ever
      </h2>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The biggest complaint thus far about EMV chip technology is that it processes cards at a snail’s pace. When the transition was still happening, transactions were certainly painfully slow, as was buyer adoption. Now that 2017 has arrived, chip credit cards are faster than magnetic strips were.

      The EMV transaction flow has 10 steps.

        <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
         The terminal reads data from that application.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
         Data is authenticated offline to make sure the card is not a counterfeit.

         Cardholder verification is done with a PIN, signature, or CVM.

      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       In addition to the extra steps involved in transactions, the signature authentication process is more accurate. PIN verification adds yet another fraud prevention layer. Identity theft becomes far more of a challenge with an EMV chip, too, since all the sensitive information magnetic strips freely gave away to criminals is secured.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       It’s important to note that EMV is not a new technology.

       They keep your buyers safe from breaches. In fact, the more aware the marketplace becomes of credit card chip benefits, the more it perceives the failure to adopt this technology as a customer service failing.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The press has bombarded consumers with enough information to write tomes about the new standard. In 2014, 60% of buyers welcomed EMV, a number that grows with every passing day.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       Even so, EMV chip cards alone are not enough: the data your reader accesses needs to be encrypted, something that the vast majority of readers don’t do. Your defence of your clients’ privacy is only as powerful as your end-to-end encryption, which should be certified by EMVCo.

      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       This kind of encryption was once the terrain of programmers and IT geeks alone, but now you’ll hear laypeople discussing it over their coffee. It’s become a part of everyday life given the sheer breadth of data theft worldwide.

       The History of Encryption
      </h2>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The internet passes information through a long string of routers, servers, and devices. At any stage, a hacker with a penchant for credit card fraud can intercept that data, so encryption was developed as a cure-all.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The data on your chip is scrambled before it travels beyond your

      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The Ancient Greeks used an encryption and authentication technique to protect Spartan military communication, and in 1500 BC, Assyrian merchants used it to protect their trade transactions.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       You don’t need to understand the jargon or participate in the encryption process to benefit from it. You only need to choose the right transaction partner.

       The Evolution of EMV Chip Adoption
      </h2>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The first EMV chip card was issued in 2010 to give valued clientele an extra tier of security and create a globally accepted card. A year later, another 1.6 million users were given chip and PIN debit cards. When smaller issuers like JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp migrated to EMV, the momentum became unstoppable.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       However, the UK adopted chip and sign cards more widely and much earlier than the U.S. They wanted to introduce technology that could process transactions online. Offline endorsements involve the use of a signature, while online ones involve the use of PINs.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       Today’s credit card security happens in layers, with each new stratum adding an extra amount of security. If hackers get past the outer layer, they still have several more to pass through if they’re to reach the sensitive data in the center.
      </p>
      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       The UK’s EMV peak happened in 2008 when there was a 40% reduction in general fraud rates. These numbers rose to over 69% for face-to-face transactions. France experienced even more startling results. Their fraud rates on domestic face-to-face transactions stood at a mere

      <p class="css-1y90lkl-text-text--giga em9rpzf0">
       Contactless terminals are also far more compact than their predecessors, so they can be carried from door to door in the pocket. Your business can thus be as mobile as you wish. All your reader needs is a mobile Android or iOS device to support transactions.
