   Ever wonder how people are compromised through a Microsoft Word document? Wanting more information on how to launch these types of attacks successfully? Act III dives deep into malicious Word documents and how to weaponize them for your own needs!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course will teach you how to compromise people through a malicious Microsoft Word document in order to infect them with your malware, ransomware, or whatever malware you have.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course is part three of a multi-part hacking guide series that is meant for people who wish to learn how to compromise people through a malicious Word document with the current hacking techniques used today. This guide is original content with pictures and screenshots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal for numbers of years I've opted into creating high quality course for the people who can afford them. I'll share my knowledge for anyone who is able to put some money on the table to get up to date hacking information. At the time of this writing this has only been sold to a few but now I'd like to open it up to the many. I can't sell my book at Waterstones so here we are.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You will learn:
   <br/>
   - The technicalities of a malicious Word document
   <br/>
   - How to create a malicious Word document to infect your target(s)
   <br/>
   - Anti-Virus evasion
   <br/>
   - How to weaponize a Word document
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You'll learn from real world examples and hacker history. All hacking methods are up to date and currently working on the latest Kali release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course isn't for everyone and is not designed to hold your hand all the way through. It does include resources, articles, and links that you should read, understand, and be able to apply the knowledge learned in order to be successful and to maximize this guide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These courses are designed to fill that "void" as a beginner hacker or future cybercriminal while learning your new found skills (using a RAT, deploying ransomware, adware, phishing, etc.).
