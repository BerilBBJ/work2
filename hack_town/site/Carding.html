    By reading through the HackTown fraud courses you'll join me on a journey as I dive deep into the realm of credit card and bank account fraud. The information and knowledge we've collectively obtained throughout all of our cybercriminal careers here at HackTown will be of great benefit to you when looking to learn the topics discussed. I've made my profits and are looking at creating something new with all the bullshit nonsense out there so time to pass the tradecraft down to the next.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    What a fucking time to be alive. Enjoy!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This course has been written by me, Funshine. However, to ensure this course was up to date and relevant it has been collaborated on from individuals I know personally and professionally over quite a long period of time. I've had to re-write some things as language barriers can be an issue for everyone so this course is written in my writing style but co-authored by friends whom I know are successful and through my own experience. Moving forward when you're reading this the course will be a combination of that. If that makes any sense.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    First off there is no one way of doing things. These courses are not the word of law when it comes to fraud but they are told from our perspective so if you have something to add, have a better way of explaining things, or anything you think that I don't know that pertains to the topics in these courses send me a god damn email and let me know what is WAT. That way we can keep it all updated for everyone to enjoy and cause a fuck show against companies. Fuck yes.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Looking back when I was starting out with fraud I probably spent roughly $3000 - 4000 USD on various items for my initial fraud operation including spending money on useless shit. To be honest most of that budget was blown on every "decent" fraud guide I came across within a (6) year period which ranged from $40 - $500 USD per guide and the ID printer I purchased wasn't cheap. I went through every carding guide that I purchased to determine if the information was valid, was I successful with what I learned, was the risk worth it, was there any information I was missing out on, and whether it was up to date.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you gain experience in fraud and you look back on the guides you purchased you realize just how terrible they truly are. The more experience in fraud I obtained the more I realized almost all of the guides I purchased were complete garbage and really didn't give me the confidence in what the fuck I was doing. Maybe you've also purchased some guides and realized the same but these course I'm releasing are as
    <b>
     relevant
    </b>
    as you'll ever come across with the experience behind them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Trust me, this is what you're looking for.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Everything at HackTown is up to date and relevant for you so don't spend any more money on useless shit until you've finished this course because it will save you a lot of money and headache this I can assure you. This course is written factual, from experience, from success, and with a story line vibe for helping you understand fraud better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Make no mistake that you will need some sort of starting budget to get your fraud operation off the ground and running. A realistic budget is important because you're going to be purchasing things such as stolen credit card information, bank accounts, burner cell phones,s credit card reading and writing equipment, printing equipment, embosser machines, VPNs, RDPs, socks, other equipment,s, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Just like any other business it takes some investment of your own money to get things going so if you're reading this right now thinking everything will be handed to you for free I want you to go out and buy an orange construction pylon, take pants and underwear off, spread ass cheeks and do a cannonball as if you were jumping into a pool right onto the pylon with DAT ASS.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't be so naive thinking everything in this world is free. Things in life are not free friends. Information is power don't you know?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I decided to take a fun journalistic approach when writing the fraud course series so you can learn how to commit fraud with modern day methods and tactics in an enjoyable way. Just like the HackTown hacking courses the fraud courses are designed in a way to get you up to date with proper information along with focusing efforts in order to be successful in 2020.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    People should be wondering why am I releasing this information? Why do this? If I'm making millions of dollars cash bills money why even try to create a place like HackTown? I know some may doubt this but believe it or not I've made quite a large sum of money mostly in the hacking world but some with fraud and have been coasting for a long time. Any hacker that has been in the game in the past 5-10 years with RATs, ransomware, and infecting everyone and everything has made a significant amount of crypto you can trust that. Plus, while making BTC during the time it went through the roof in price was a fun ride. amirite?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honestly the reason I'm quitting the fraud game is because of the fuck faces at ClearView AI. I'm an instore carder and have been since I realized online carding was too time consuming for the amounts I was profiting and just sick of my eBay accounts getting shut down lol. ClearView AI has completely spooked me because no doubt they have my face someone on a security footage and some fuck face cop is going to plug it into the big data machine and out comes my FaceBook linked to me. Fucking awesome. See ya in 20 guys. You get what I mean so I'm retiring from my carding life given the nature in how I operate. This is my gift to people wanting to learn carding so fuck it. Enjoy this shit.

    I'm looking at moving forward in my retirement and create a wicked side project and putting the information, knowledge, and my experience for people to learn from here at HackTown. This is not a hand out, but a hand up.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Truth be told most companies are actually getting more cyber secure while operating on the internet. Wow! No shit! Mother fuckers like us are getting a little out of control so this makes sense. The window of opportunity is closing so let's maximize this together! You don't have to go full tits out right away with carding but the amount of online fraud that happens is fucking mind blowing. Why miss the boat?

    I know what it was like to pay for bullshit guides, be scammed by vendors, come across mis-information, lose money to exit scam after exit scam, and just getting lost down the rabbit hole trying to find reputable people and knowledge. I was 12 too once but as an adult you know people are making money from fraud and you just want that knowledge too. It's fucking frustrating ya? Like where do I click to make a million dollars?! Well luckily you're here now. The reality is, as you'll come to learn, once you're at a certain level with hacking or fraud (intermidiate ish level to superman level) you really don't need anyone else. Once people learn how to perform fraud, hacking, carding, etc. successfully they just vanish because they've figured it out, or at least think they've figured it out. It's just getting that knowledge can be tricky. HackTown is designed in a way to give you this knowledge you seek.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've taken the time to do all the leg work for you and have put together this fraud guide series to rocket ship your knowledge ahead of the rest so you're in a position to make money. The year is 2020 and it's time to get up to date information and caught up with everything fraud related.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope you enjoy part one of the fraud courses and if you've read the HackTown hacking series then I know you will enjoy this. Stop wasting your time learning shit from 2011 so sit back, smoke crack, relax, and enjoy.
    <br/>

    There was one guide I enjoyed during the middle of my fraud career. I learned a lot from Tor Carding Forums (TCF) and had some great times there with awesome partnerships. So, I want you to read a guide that came out of TCF and take a moment to read through it all. It was created by alpha02 who was the administrator of the dark marketplace called Alphabay. If you don't know who alpha02 was or what TCF was then Google them because it's an excellent resource to build on before beginning this carding course.

    Those (2) carding guides are an extra resource you can go through anytime on your own. More knowledge the better and with different perspectives of fraud this will help you develop.
