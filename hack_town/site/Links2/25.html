     While
 fans of different operating systems might debate which one is the most 
stable' reliable' flexible or user-friendly' there’s one inarguable 
point: Every machine – regardless of the OS – can run into issues.

  And while users historically would pop a boot media disk into their DVD or CD drive' many computers no longer come with optical disk drives. As a result' booting from USB media is becoming the standard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  How you start that rescue media can vary depending on the operating 
system you are using' but there are a few general guidelines that can 
help get your machine started' regardless of the OS you prefer.
So if your system is unstable' you need to run a diagnostic tool on the 
hard drive' or you just want to load a Linux desktop just to see what 
it’s all about' let’s look at how you start your machine using rescue 
USB boot media.

   How to boot a Mac from USB media
  </h2>
  <p>
   Getting your Mac to load from a USB drive is fairly straightforward.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Insert the USB boot media into an open USB slot.
   </li>
   <li value="2">
    Press the
    <strong>
     Power
    </strong>
    button to turn on your Mac (or
    <strong>
     Restart
    </strong>
    your Mac if it’s already on).
   </li>
   <li value="3">
    When you hear the startup chime' press and hold the
    <strong>
     Option
    </strong>
    key.
 Holding that key gives you access to OS X’s Startup Manager. Once the 
Startup Manager screen appears' release the Option key. The utility will
 look for any available drives that include bootable content.
   </li>
   <li value="4">
    Using either the pointer or arrow keys on the keyboard' select the USB drive you wish to boot from.
   </li>
   <li value="5">
    Once selected' either hit the
    <strong>
     Return
    </strong>
    key or double-click your selection. The machine will start to boot from the USB drive.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   <strong>
    NOTE:
   </strong>
   Have
 multiple USB devices connected to your Mac? Don’t worry. The Startup 
Manager only lists drives that include bootable content.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Boot from USB: Windows
  </h2>
  <p>
   Starting
 your PC using USB rescue media is not difficult' although it first 
requires an adjustment in the BIOS (Basic Input Output System). That’s 
because the BIOS settings include the boot sequence the machine follows 
when starting up. The boot order tells the machine which devices to 
search for the software needed to launch the computer and the priority 
each device in that search.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If you’re booting from USB media' you must change the BIOS boot order so
 the USB device is listed first. Otherwise the computer will load from 
the hard drive as normal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Start by plugging the thumb drive into a USB port. Then t
   <strong>
    o change the BIOS boot sequence
   </strong>
   :
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Press the
    <strong>
     Power
    </strong>
    button for your computer.
   </li>
   <li>
    During the initial startup screen' press
    <strong>
     ESC' F1' F2' F8
    </strong>
    or
    <strong>
     F10
    </strong>
    . (Depending on the company that created your version of BIOS' a menu may appear.)
   </li>
   <li>
    When you choose to enter BIOS Setup' the setup utility page will appear.
   </li>
   <li>
    Using the arrow keys on your keyboard' select the
    <strong>
     <em>
      BOOT
     </em>
    </strong>
    tab.
 All of the available system devices will be displayed in order of their
 boot priority. You can reorder the devices here.
   </li>
   <li>
    Move
    <em>
     USB
    </em>
    to be first in the boot sequence.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>
     NOTE:
    </strong>
    If you cannot find
    <em>
     USB
    </em>
    or
    <em>
     Removable Devices
    </em>
    among the device options' your BIOS may list it under
    <em>
     Hard Drive Devices
    </em>
    . In that case' you’ll need to:
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
     <li>
      Move
      <em>
       Hard Drive Devices
      </em>
      to the top
     </li>
     <li>
      Expand to show all hard drive device options
     </li>
     <li>
      Move
      <em>
       USB device
      </em>
      to the top of that hard drive list
      <br/>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Save the change and then exit the BIOS Setup.
   </li>
   <li>
    The computer will restart using the new settings' booting from your USB drive.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Stay alert!
    </strong>
    Depending on your BIOS' you may be prompted with a message to
    <em>
     Press any key to boot from external device
    </em>
    and you will only have a few seconds to respond. If you do nothing' 
your computer will go to the next device in the boot sequence list' 
which will likely be your hard drive.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   In the future' your 
computer will first check the USB port for boot media when starting up. 
That won’t be a problem' since the BIOS will move to the next device in 
the boot sequence ... unless you keep the boot media in the USB port. 
Then the system will launch from that device every time.

   Linux USB Boot Process
  </h2>
  <p>
   <strong>
    To boot Ubuntu from USB media' the process is very similar to the Windows instructions above.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Confirm the BIOS boot sequence lists the USB drive first' or make that change as needed.
   </li>
   <li>
    After the USB flash drive is inserted into the USB port' press the
    <strong>
     Power
    </strong>
    button for your machine (or
    <strong>
     Restart
    </strong>
    if the computer is running).
   </li>
   <li>
    The installer boot menu will load' where you will select
    <em>
     Run Ubuntu from this USB
    </em>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Ubuntu
 will launch and you can begin to working in the system – setting 
preferences' reconfiguring the system as needed' or running any 
diagnostic tools.
   </li>
