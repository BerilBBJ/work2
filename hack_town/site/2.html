    You probably have a little understanding about how hackers make money because you've probably heard about ransomware, Remote Access Trojan (RAT), adware, hackers blackmailing people with their photos/videos, email account takeovers, etc. right?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Learning to do all that shit can be confusing and depending on your level of intelligence can be downright impossible for you to actually achieve.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I want to try and get you into a mindset that hopefully motivates you in achieving your hacking goals whatever they may be. I truly hope they are devious greedy money-making plans in nature yes? People work in order to make money to spend on College or University in order to obtain their "careers" and then make
    <b>
     more
    </b>
    money. Just like in the real world you need to spend money on your cybercriminal "career" as well. You need the right knowledge, expertise, and the proper tools to succeed.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The thought of learning how to "hack" deters most people starting out in their devious hacker ways. What type of hacker do you want to be? What realistically is going to be your hacking skill level? Are you going to be able to code your own ransomware? Will you be able to code your own RAT that steals credit card data and banking information? What program language should you be learning first?!? C++, ASM, Java? Python?! Maybe you should get a computer science or cyber security degree so you can end up working at the Apple store. Fuck! Right?! It's information fucking overload man. When all you want to do is send some ransomware to a bunch of mother fuckers and infect their shit so they can pay you money to get their data back.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well my friends I hope this hacking series changes your mindset and puts you on the path to success.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Let's get back to that mindset. I want you to think of
    <b>
     WHY
    </b>
    you're wanting to learn how to hack. We all have goals yes? What are your goals with learning hacking?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're thinking to yourself right now as you're reading this "I want to learn hacking for fun!" then you're a retard. Why would you want to learn hacking for fun?! Do you want to sell drugs for fun?! Do you want to vandalise a store for fun?! Why would you want to commit a crime for fun? Don't be dumb because this shit gets really serious once you cross a certain legal line. I hope you understand that by reading through these courses you're choosing the path of becoming a blackhat and joining the darkside. Join me my friends, the water is just fine.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you're reading this then you should have an idea of what this hacking series will be about. The goal with these courses is to get up to speed with hacking and cyber criminally related things that will enable you to perform the same type of attacks for profit. I've created a new cybercriminal platform called HackTown that will focus soley on specific topics purely on the Blackhat side of things. Lucky you! These courses I've created, along with future courses, will focus on learning the side of hacking for profit and teach you how to compromise individuals, small businesses, and organizations for your own desires.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The reality is the new age cybercriminal doesn't need to learn any programming languages or any of that shit anymore. Now and days you can buy whatever you require and fuck shit up in no time. Some malware developers are selling RATs, ransomware, and some really sophisticated malware out there that is a click away for you to obtain. With the knowledge you'll learn through these courses and at HackTown you'll be launching the same type of attacks as government hackers do on others around the world. There is also a career path for the fraudsters out there at HackTown as well.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Don't get discouraged when learning the trade. We all have technical limits and our own opportunities when it comes to making money in hacking. Stay focused, learn from the right people, and put effort into educating yourself in the hacking fields you want to focus in on.

    Alright that's enough of my bullshit prep talk. Let's start talking about what you're going to be learning from Act II shall we? Have you hacked your neighbors Wi-Fi network or you're connected to your local coffee shop Wi-Fi and not sure where to hack next? Wondering how to push your freshly purchased RAT or ransomware onto everyone on the WiFi network?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This course is part two of a multi-part hacking guide series that is meant for people who wish to learn the career path of the modern day hacker and cybercriminal without going through a million different forums  that will take you a fuck ton of time to find, search, read, find out that what you read is outdated and old, get confused, get stuck down a rabbit hole, blah blah blah. These courses are original content created by myself, Funshine. If you copy and paste my work please at least reference HackTown so others can learn, enjoy, and collaborate on taking over the world. This will be updated as new techniques, tactics, and tradecraft are released so keep an eye on the forums where you found this for updates or think about joining HackTown as a member.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you've found this course then we can assume you've finished the previous ACTS and are ready to expand your knowledge with hacking and fine tune your skills. If you haven't read ACT 0 and ACT I then it's assumed you're familiar with being able to remain anonymous while hacking' that you already know how to hack WiFi networks, and that you're able to get onto WiFi networks you don't own. Hopefully if you've read Act I then you've successfully hacked onto a WiFi network and you're connected to a home network, small business WiFi, or a local coffee shop access point, etc. and have internet. I won't get into the corporate Wi-Fi network items as I think this might be too advanced for most reading this. Who's kidding who for those who have successfully compromised a corporate Wi-Fi network and still maintain access than I think you have a handle on your shit. Maybe. Sometimes yes sometimes no. For the rest, you need to walk before you're able to run comrades.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Act II guide is geared towards delivering a RAT, malware, ransomware, etc. to others while on hacked home Wi-Fi networks, coffee shop Wi-Fi network, libraries, small business Wi-Fi networks, etc. You'll learn up to date Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks and begin to understand the threat landscape for such attacks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Once you're on a network you don't own there are plenty of things you're able to accomplish besides getting free interwebs, downloading all your gay porn, and torrenting the fuck out of your shows. In Act II we're more interested in the super sly richman boss cybercriminal way of doing things right? Like fuck that I have  ransomware I just purchased and this needs to be out there real quick kind of mindset yes? By reading this you'll get caught up with the current MITM attacks and see why these type of attacks are ideal for spreading your malware, ransomware, RAT, etc. once on a compromised Wi-Fi network. This will be the core of this course in relation to MITM attacks and will get you up to date with everything MITM related as phishing will be talked about in a future guide that will build upon the knowledge you will learn here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've decided to make HackTown into a cybercriminal platform for enjoyment, learning, and joining the cybercriminal career. These courses are created in a way so you're able to learn and understand current modern day attacks in 2020 to make money and become the best hacker/cybercriminal that you're able to be. I hope you enjoy my writing style friends.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I anticipate this course brings you some knowledge and helps you with your hacking adventures. Creating these courses takes time and effort to deliver them in a way that is beneficial for you. I remember coming across great guides when I was learning hacking that changed my mindset and helped me greatly. I'd like to return the favor. You just don't want to learn "hacking" but you want to learn it in a way that is profitable for yourself whichever way you decide to take it. Take it to the limit if you can. I hope you're able to learn something from this or this sparks some ideas in your head for cyber war/world domination. I would expect nothing less commanders. The meth is kicking in now I can feel it. Globalization is a tricky thing for the people who don't live in the "right" countries yes? Where are the jobs at? And the pay? Fuck me mans. Let me spends hours pen testing bullshit company to make no money while other Blackhat hackers with my same knowledge are fucking blowing by me making thousands if not hundreds of thousands in less than a year. Yeah OK working in cyber security is negative experience. I went to my publishers to get this published and they wouldn't do it? Can you believe that shit?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, some of us are forced to monetize the skills we have. Be that questionable or not. Yes? Some people sell drugs, some people sell guns, some people sell people, and some people turn to  cybercrime world balls to the wall and make dollarzzzzzzzzz and if that's the case let me help guide you down the proper path.

    Most of this course is intended for a *nix audience, however, Windows users will still benefit from this. There will be points throughout this guide marked in
    <font color="blue">
     <b>
      BLUE
     </b>
    </font>
    . These points are useful to fully grasp the concepts taught and help with understanding techniques and explanations on various topics. It's important that when you read them you stop and take the time to do what they say or follow up with them. The syntax of code to be typed into Terminal or the command line will be
    <font color="red">
     <b>
      RED
     </b>
    </font>
    . So anytime you see something in
    <font color="red">
     <b>
      RED
     </b>
    </font>
    you know that it's syntax code and should be entered into Kali, Terminal, Windows command line, etc.
