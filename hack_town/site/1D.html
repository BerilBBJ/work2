  </h2>
  <p align="left">
   This course will teach you how to compromise W-Fi networks around you and is an excellent skill for any cybercriminal today.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Where are you right now? Which network are you connected to? Maybe you're sitting at a library, coffee shop, at work, or your own home network. If the authorities or otherwise have tracked your IP to where you are right now would this be bad for you? Maybe you don't care and maybe you do. Want to learn how to avoid that? Thinking about committing fraud, hacking a company/person and want to remain undetected? Want to learn the steps in a cybercriminal career? Read on comrades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course is part of a multi-part hacking guide series that is meant for people who wish to learn how hack Wi-Fi networks with the current Wi-Fi hacking techniques used today. This course is original content and is over 100 pages with pictures, videos, and screenshots.

   <br/>
   Since I enjoy writing and have been a journalist, activist, hacktivist, turned cybercriminal for numbers of years I've opted into creating high quality course for the people who can afford them. At the time of this writing this has only been sold to a few but now I'd like to open it up to the many. I can't sell my book at Waterstones so here we are.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This guide is good for:
   <br/>
   - Hackers
   <br/>
   - Fraudsters
   <br/>
   - Vendors
   <br/>
   - Soon to be Vendors
   <br/>
   - Soon to be Hackers
   <br/>
   - Soon to be Fraudsters
   <br/>
   Topics that you will learn:
   <br/>
   - Learn from a hacker's perspective
   <br/>
   - Hacking Wi-Fi networks
   <br/>
   - Capturing WiFi credentials with rogue access points
   <br/>
   - All scripts and programs provided
   <br/>
   - Up to date attacks and more!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You'll learn from real world examples and hacker history. All Wi-Fi hacking methods are up to date and currently working on the latest Kali release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This course isn't for everyone and is not designed to hold your hand all the way through. It does include resources, articles, and links that you should read, understand, and be able to apply the knowledge learned in order to be successful and to maximize this course. Treat this as a University course and you will be successful.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These courses are designed to fill that "void" as a beginner hacker or future cybercriminal while learning your new found skills (using a RAT, deploying ransomware, adware, phishing, etc.). Itâ€™s important to be able to practice in the real world without being caught which would suck shit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Looking for more information on how to become a hacker? Wanting more information on how to remain online anonymously for whatever illegal thing you plan on doing on the internet? This course is designed to give you the knowledge and skills to make your digital footprint impossible to track. Let's cause some chaos but let's do it safely for us.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Take the next step and cross into the black side of hacking for profit and pirating.
