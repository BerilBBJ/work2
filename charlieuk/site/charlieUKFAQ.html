1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

       Q: I am new to PGP can i order without using it?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       A:
      </strong>
      Yes we can still take your order but prefer encrypted communications as it prevents our and your email providers from eavesdropping on information such as your order and address. It is more for your protection than ours and we do advise against not using PGP. Please watch a 5 minute youtube video to get your head around it....(PRIVNOTE)is also a good alternative for beginners!

      <strong>
       Q: What is your policy for data protection?
      </strong>
     </p>

      </strong>
      emails will be deleted two days after the order has been recieved, all
      <strong>
       your data
      </strong>
      is
      <strong>
       safe
      </strong>
      and erased regularly and can not be accessed by anyone. period! Our backup private key is kept very securely and out of reach! WE WILL PROTECT UNENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS IN THE SAME MANNER, BUT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR OR OUR EMAIL PROVIDERS WILL NOT EAVESDROP / AS EMPHASISED IN THE QUESTION ABOUT ORDERING WITHOUT USING PGP!
