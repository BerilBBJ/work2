<p>This is Tor.  Tor makes people untraceable.  This allows criminals to make fraudulent sites that scam average people who work hard for their money.  BUT you may be able to get your bitcoin back!</p>



<p><strong>Blockchain Analysis</strong> – If you sent them bitcoin then it might be possible to trace it. At Queens Cash we convert all BTC to Monero(XMR), and XMR is untraceable.   We have to do this because we are being pursued by powerful forces.  The people who run scam sites are stupid idiots and most of the time you can trace the bitcoin.   </p>



<p><strong>Report them</strong>: You will trace them to Coinbase, Luno,
Binance, Poloniex or others.  Report them as scammers to that
company.  Tell them that you made a mistake and ordered from them. 
Tell them that you will cooperate with that company to bring that
person to justice.  Need help tracing the bitcoin?  Contact
“<a href="mailto:shredder@ctemplar.com">shredder@ctemplar.com</a>”
who can trace it for free.  He is very busy so it might take him a
while.  We are committed to destroying scammers. That’s why we give
our users the tools they need to cause scammers pain. 
</p>



<p><strong>Don’t contact the Law</strong>: Let the company(Luno/Coinbase/Poloniex/ext) contact Law Enforcement.  If you contact law enforcement they will add you to a watch list, and you will be monitored by law enforcement for the rest of your life.  If you ever do any tiny illegal thing, they will be at your house to send you to jail because they will be watching you all the time.  It’s not worth it.  If the company does it then nothing negative should happen to you probably.  </p>



<p><strong>Result:</strong> The company will report the scammer to law
enforcement.  Then that person might go to jail and get fucked in the
ass.  If they had funds in their account at the time of the bust,
those funds will be frozen because they are scammers. You will get
your money (BTC) back as long as you can prove you are the one who
bought it.  Need help with that? Contact “<a href="mailto:shredder@ctemplar.com">shredder@ctemplar.com</a>”
who will help you for free. 
</p>



<p><strong>Consider Murder:</strong> The company might tell you who scammed you.  If they tell this to you, think about murdering them.  If you need help finding a group that can murder someone of your selection contact “<a href="mailto:apt666@ctemplar.com">apt666@ctemplar.com</a>”.  They will charge at least $5,750.  Yes there are cheaper options. But this group will make the murder look random and it will not be connected to you.  They have been in operation for 5 years and obviously the fact they are still in operation proves they know what their doing.  </p>

<p>We
have two groups of competitors. Sites that have cloned our site and
fraud buyers.  And sites that also sell preshred that they have
purchased from us.  
</p>



<h4><strong>Sites Stealing From Our New Buyers:  </strong></h4>



<p>There are many other sites that have “Cloned” our site.  They did this to steal from people trying to buy product from us.  If we think about this logically one of the sites MUST be legit and real because many others exist to fraud the truthful site. In other words people are using the trust built from the real site(us) to fraud new buyers with their fraud site.  We can not do anything about it.  This is anonymous TOR so we cannot track them down and murder them.  And we can not call the police to fix the situation because we are criminals.   We&#8217;re the legit site. Buy from those other sites and you&#8217;ll get fucked. How do you know we’re the real site?   </p>



<p><strong>Community Trust: </strong>We are the site that the community posted to the real Hidden Wiki.  If we are stole from anyone the community would remove our listing.  Trust us because hundreds of other people trust us.  Trust us because we have thousands of reviews from several years.  </p>



<p><strong>Escrow</strong>: We are the only site that is willing to use escrow.  Escrow means the money (Bitcoin) is NOT going directly to the seller (us) but is being held by an impartial third party (Escrow Company) until you receive the goods and are happy with them.  If there are any problems you can get your bitcoin back. We are the ONLY site willing to use escrow when we sell to our buyers.  We only use escrow on large orders because that escrow can delay payment for a long time and sometimes we lose our payment due to fraudulent buyers.  So we are only willing to go through this hassle with serious buyers.  </p>



<h4>Other “Pre-Shred” sellers. 
</h4>



<p>Everyone cant steal like the FED like we do.  It’s just not
possible.  So how can other sites sell ‘pre-shred’ cash?  We sell
other sites ‘pre-shred’ cash in bulk for them to resell.  We only
sell them the shittiest cash that we dont want.  
</p>



<p>So why buy from us and not them?  The cash you buy from other sites is in such bad condition it might not work at ATM&#8217;s or at banks.  It&#8217;s shitty thats why we sold it to them in bulk.  100% of our cash will work at banks and ATM&#8217;s. </p>
