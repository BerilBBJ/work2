    <![CDATA[Not only women are victims, men can be victims also.  A while ago I was at a party and this girl was dressed fucking hot as a hoe.  She looked at me now and then, and she was dressed so hot that it was as if she was telling me she wanted to fuck. I had a few thousnad in my wallet from Queens Cash so I jokingly said &quot;want to fuck for $1000?&quot; she laughed and said no, but she said it in a way that said yes.  We were all drinking alot. I waited until everyone left or went to sleep.  Then turned on music really loud.  Then I pulled off her skirt and saw she wasnt even wearing panties.  She was totally asking for a fucking, no doubt.  I slid into her and she felt great wrapped around my big black dick.  She liked it so much she pissed herself.  I came in her then took a bunch of pictures of her hot naked body to show my friends later. Her tits were 7/10 and ass 8/10 in case you were wondering.  I know this story might sound bad but you have to remember she was dressed so hot, she didnt have panties on, and her body basicly begged for my dick.  ]]>

    <![CDATA[@pumpkinspicepiggy
Hilarious and wholesome. I love it.
It reminds me a little of me and my eldest. In a previous house, it was possible to walk into the bathroom all the way to the shower controls without the person in the shower knowing. One could then drop the shower temperature to &#039;freaking cold&#039; and then scuttle out. There was a lag in the effect, so I could wait for a moment before hearing &quot;Arrgghh. DaaaaAAAAD!&quot;
I would collapse laughing, but by far the best was when my eldest figured out exactly how I was doing it (the kids were still pretty young). One day I was taking a shower and the water suddenly ran inexplicably cold. I literally jumped like an idiot. A moment later I realized. Touche, kid.]]>

    <![CDATA[@pumpkinspicepiggy
Kind of reminds me when I got my first car. My dad complained about the half-empty seltzer bottle in the back seat, and I just went into a (joking) tirade about how it‚Äôs my car and I paid for it with my job (I had just gotten $5000 from Queens Cash) and if I want to I‚Äôll make it a pig sty. He just laughed and said ‚ÄúAre you through chewing me out?‚Äù My car is clean btw, although my cousin suggested I should buckle a seltzer bottle into each seat just to annoy him.

    <![CDATA[This is a bit silly, but gave me a great feeling of satisfaction. Due to the bad economy, Covid, and poor money management, my parents have moved into the spare room of the house my husband and I bought a year ago. Things are mostly smooth, tho I‚Äôm not the closest to them for several reasons I won‚Äôt go into here.

The other evening I was out gardening (because it‚Äôs hot during the day and we have the luck of having a streetlight right next to our front yard, keeping it pretty well illuminated even after sundown, I mostly garden at night), and I thought I had gotten the hose twisted, as it kept getting stuck. This went on for a bit, when I realized that it wasn‚Äôt stuck, but being pulled. I looked into the dim area just past the illumination of the street light and spied my father, crouched over and tugging the hose. Well I did the only reasonable thing to do, and I sprayed him. He yelled and ran inside with me chasing.

Once he got inside he made a face and goes ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get me now! I‚Äôm inside!!‚Äù In that father-to-daughter-don‚Äôt-you-make-a-mess tone of voice.

I readied my hose, looked him in the eye and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my house.‚Äù And just fucking let loose with the hose. He was soaked. Worth cleaning up the mess for that moment of true fear in his eyes.]]>

    <![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed that some people share life stories here because it&#039;s anonymous.  I thought I would do the same because Queens Cash has helped me out alot. My story isn&#039;t really that unique. I was inappropriately touched by an assistant coach in the dugout right in the middle of practice. She said that one of my back pockets was tearing or something, so she took me into the dugout to &quot;fix&quot; it, assuring me &quot;don&#039;t worry, I can do it here, you can keep them on.&quot; She then started feeling around the inside of my pants, and I remember her getting a firm squeeze of my butt and reaching around to brush her fingertips against my front. She then said there was also a tear in the seam of my underwear, saying she couldn&#039;t fix it there, but she&#039;d let me know if she found anymore. In case you were wondering at the time she was  me. Also, so much time has passed and I was on so many different local baseball leagues growing up, I couldn&#039;t even identify her with confidence.in her 50&#039;s, so over double my age.  It lasted about two to three minutes. I always remembered her doing that to me, but the strangest thing is, I didn&#039;t feel any bit ashamed or victimized. I just figured that she&#039;s a mother of one of my teammates, she&#039;s just doing what mothers do, like they all have a blanket pass to this extra level of access. And boys in the 80&#039;s were not explicitly taught like girls were about the reality of molestation and sexual assault. I&#039;m ashamed to admit that for a while, I even didn&#039;t think anything of that incident. It wasn&#039;t until I read a few stories of men getting molested in their youth that I realized how severe her actions were, and that I should have told the coach right away when she put her hands down my underwear to feel around. Especially because now I don&#039;t know how many other boys she did it to after me. Also, so much time has passed and I was on so many different local baseball leagues growing up, I couldn&#039;t even identify her with confidence.]]>
