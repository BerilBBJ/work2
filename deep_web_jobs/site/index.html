       We will send you weekly a Design Request Document, in PDF format, that will specify the things that we require for making the website, and the amount you will obtain for the design.
       <br/>
       After you finish one design or a week passes (whoever comes before), we will send you another Design Request Document. So you have a job per week assured.

       The designs will consist in websites, which will have between 2 and 6 different sections / webpages / windows.

After that, you will have to make the API (in PHP), for the things that need server processing (BD, for example). But almost everything will be Frontend.
