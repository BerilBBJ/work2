    <![CDATA[I wish I would have started investing in my 20s rather then in my 60s. The other day I took my 2 grandsons 8 &amp; 9 years old, I had feel the gold I purchsed from Gold diamonds. We went through some of the collection letting them hold the gold. It gave us about a 1/2 hour of pure enjoyment. No computers involved! They looked at the gold nuggets with great questions from how much does this weigh to what is it made of? I&#039;m looking forward receiving smore gold nuggets to show them. Spending quality time! Precious a win win situation. ]]>

    <![CDATA[I&#039;m here because I lost my job after crashing an entire chemical plant by completely fucking a download and faulting the controller. Lots of screaming and much, MUCH tension, but the product was still in spec. The &quot;oh shit, my software isn&#039;t responding. Did I just break something or is this poorly optimized, proprietary bullshit software just having a seizure?&quot; question sucks, every time.  I&#039;ve been ordering gold here ever since, about 13 months.  I get the maximum amount (8 ounces) each month and it pays all my bills. ]]>

    <![CDATA[@sspecZ 
I had to have an elbow put back together after a work accident (metal stairs in the rain should have railings) and it&#039;s healed up perfectly with no complaints! ... except that if I hold anything really cold or frozen in that hand I get a horrible intense pain in my elbow.
I also think it would be good if they allowed orders more frequently than once per month, and greater than 8 ounces per order. ]]>

    <![CDATA[I had a great surgical team I&#039;m just low on money because of how expensive it all was. That&#039;s why I&#039;m asking about increasing the amount of gold I can buy at a time. It would also be nice to allow orders more frequently than once per month. 
and I was on my feet all day and and do lots of treadmill work. They said because I had good musculature my recovery should be while not easy, no major issues. They did a great job putting it back together. The only &quot;holdup&quot; during surgery was waiting for some doctors to get there to see it. Every medical person that&#039;s see this has been OH God!Coming up on 2 years and no issues. It sometimes has a minor ouch during cold spells... But that might just be I&#039;m 58...]]>

    <![CDATA[Any chance you can increase the limit above 8 ounce of gold per order?  Extention ladder slipped out from under me. I was less than 6 feet off the floor. My left leg went into the rungs and snapped my femur.  Here&#039;s a picture of it: https://www.imgur.com/a/N7pPIOo]]>
