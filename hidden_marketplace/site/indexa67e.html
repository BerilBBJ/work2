      Best DJ head phones hands down if your an actual DJ who spin at clubs and bars. Especially for $120 I got it for. Very loud and bass heavy and the folding cups with dual cord jacks on each side are nice features. I do not recommend this for average consumer using for listening to music daily on a smart phone. It's not made for that purpose. If your device does not support the quarter inch jack, you're not going get the full effect of the head phones. It's on the heavy side it's not made for casual listening. For mobile djs, it's built to last. My original Beats pro from 2011 is still working great. This non Monster version also seem to have improved sound qualify as well. Very happy with this purchase.

      The quality of sound from this headphone set is amazing! Best and clearest sound I’ve heard EVER!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The material quality is very heavy which bothers my daughter who has sensory issues. My son doesn’t mind the extra weight at all.

      They work just as advertised, initially I thought that they would be just some cheaply made, highly priced and popularized by the people kind of headphone. I didn't see what the hype was about them , they worked just the same as any other headphones I already owned, or so I thought. When I finally decided to purchase them all I could think about was the price, if they were really worth that much for an experience my gas station headphones could already give me, then the day came when they arrived to my door. Out of the box, there was no damage, inspecting each angle of it to make sure that, for the price, I got mine in perfect condition, and they were, no shipping scuffs, scratches or anything, almost like I got what was straight out of the picture, but with the just as good looking cords. I finally folded them down, put them on my head, and plugged the modular cord into my phone, then my headset. I went to my music, started some of my favorite electronic music, and found myself astonished at the audio quality, base, treble, everything all perfect. You virtually can't hear anything if you're not wearing the headphones unless you're really trying to, or you are just in a very silent room. Nearly everything about them is perfect, the only thing I don't approve of, is the price tag, even if they are nothing like any other audio peripheral I've ever used, the price tag is excessive.
