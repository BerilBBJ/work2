    <![CDATA[<h1><strong>Buy Liberty caps mushroom</strong></h1>
<p>Commonly known as the <b>liberty cap</b>, is a species <b>of</b> fungus which produces the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and baeocystin. Many people do not know that three types of Liberty caps can be found in The Netherlands. The pointy Liberty cap (<i>Psilocybe semilanceata</i>) is the best known, Buy Liberty caps mushroom. These can be found in the eastern part of the country. Almost all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">information</a> on the <a href="https://google.com/">Internet</a> about Liberty caps concerns this type.</p>
<h4><strong>Types of liberty caps</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Psilocybe liniformans</i> is distinguished by a slimy border exactly under the lamella. This border can be pulled off like a rubber band.</li>
<li><i>Psilocybe fimetaria</i> on the other hand has more of a blue base than other Liberty caps. The pointy Liberty cap, as the name implies, has a sharp cap.</li>
<li><i>Stropharia fimetaria ,then there is Psilocybe liniformans. These are very rare and almost only occur in the Netherlands where they are called <strong>slijmrandkaalkopje</strong>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>They contain the same psychoactive substance as Mexican and Hawaiian mushrooms. Even so Liberty caps have another effect. You could compare the difference in effect as the difference between wine and beer. The beverages contain alcohol yet one becomes drunk in a different way from both. This is the result of wine or beer containing different substances which give the alcohol another effect. In the same way there is also a difference in effect if you compare Liberty caps with other mushrooms containing <a href="https://gettrippyshop.com/shop/">psilocybin</a>.</p>
<p>Liberty caps are considered to be very friendly mushrooms. They are also very social mushrooms. In other words when you use them you become empathic, you will chat a lot and frequently become joyful. Sometimes there are bouts of uncontrolled laughter. In general Liberty caps do not result in strong hallucinations, such as Hawaiian mushrooms can produce. However, they can lead to deeper insights.

<h2>How to I.D Identify Liberty caps</h2>
<p>.</p>
<p><img src="https://azarius.net/media/images/encyclopedie/kaalkopje-3.jpg" width="291" loading="lazy" class="alignright" alt="Liberty caps in hand" height="236" align="right" /></p>
<h2>HOW TO RECOGNISE mushrooms?</h2>
<p>You find them on grassy peats and clay grounds, such as old clay dikes or dug up farmland. This ground is barren or lightly fertilized. If you find a mushroom on another spot, for example in a forest or on a tree, then it will certainly be no Liberty cap.</p>
<p>They have a conical hat with pointed blotch. These have an average section of 5 up to 15 mm and are 6 to 13 mm high. When fresh they are olive green to greyish brown. If you let them dry they change into straw yellow or ochre. The spores are black to purple-brown. The lamellae are pale brown-grey to violet-brown. The stem is 5 up to 9 cm long with a section of approximately 1 up to 2 mm.</p>
<p>The colour of the stem is whitish or cream. The base sometimes has a blue-green tint. The flesh of the cap is grey brown or beige. They have a mild taste and smell a bit like radish. They have a striking transparent slimy coat which you can pull off with tweezers.</p>
<p>When you bend or snap them a little, a blue discolouring will be seen. If you see this colour you will know with certainty that you deal with Liberty caps. This colour appears because psilocybin oxidises when contacting air. Other mushrooms do not contain this substance and as a result do show the same discolouring.</p>
