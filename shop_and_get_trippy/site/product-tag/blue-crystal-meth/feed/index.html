    <![CDATA[<h1><strong>Buy 4-AcO DMT</strong></h1>
<p><b><i>O</i>-Acetylpsilocin</b> (also known as <b>psilacetin</b>, <b>4-acetoxy-DMT</b>, or Buy <b>4-AcO DMT</b>) is a semi-synthetic psychoactive drug, and has been suggested by <a title="David E. Nichols" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols">David Nichols </a>. Then it is to be a potentially useful alternative to psilocybin for pharmacological studies. Yet they are both believed to be prodrugs of psilocin.</p>
<h4><strong>How It looks like</strong></h4>
<p>This appears as a white or beige powder (sometimes dark) with a crystalline appearance, without particular adhesion. This powder is also sold in capsule form by some suppliers, more rarely in vials. Nowadays, it is the most popular of the synthetic/semi-synthetic tryptamines although the use of these substances remains limited.</p>
<h3>4-AcO DMT Dosage</h3>
<p>It is usually sold as a fumarate salt (4-AcO-DMT fumarate) containing on average 1 mg pure 4-AcO-DMT for every 1.24 mg of the powder. Or if it’s a hydrochloride salt, it will contain on average 1 mg pure for every 1.15 mg of the powder. In practice the difference may be negligible, but it’s worth knowing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oral dosage (approximate) (according to Erowid)</li>
<li>Threshold of effect: 5-10 mg</li>
<li>Low: 10-20 mg</li>
<li>Common: 20-30 mg</li>
<li>Strong: 30-50 + mg</li>
</ul>
<h2>Effects of 4-AcO DMT and how long DMT lasts in the body</h2>
<p>Surprisingly the effects of the molecule are close to those felt with magic mushrooms like those of the psilocybe genus. It is very representative of this adage. The overall duration of the trip is about 3 to 6 hours, depending on the dose and the person.</p>
<h3><span id="Les_effets_désirés"></span><span id="Les_effets_d.C3.A9sir.C3.A9s" class="mw-headline">Desired effects</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Physical and intellectual stimulation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feeling of euphoria</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Increased sociability</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Want to express yourself and go to others</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>disinhibition</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feeling of well-being</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exacerbation of the senses</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unbridled libido</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Risk of consuming 4-AcO DMT</strong></h3>
<p>The relative toxicity of 4-AcO-DMT and more specifically neurologically is a fortiori low, as is the psilocine: almost no neurotoxicity. But these are only exageration and the reality is that no serious scientific study has been conducted on the subject.</p>
<p>Notably, physical risks including vomiting, loss of consciousness, and seizures, but these are fairly uncommon. As far as we know, nobody has died from taking it nor is it likely to be physically dangerous for most people.</p>
<p>As with any psychedelic, it should probably be avoided by pregnant or breastfeeding women or anyone prone to seizures. Basically  heart problems, blood pressure problems, or mental health issues like severe anxiety. If only to err on the side of caution given the lack of clinical research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Puffs of anxiety</li>

<li>depersonalization</li>

    <![CDATA[<p>Methamphetamine is a potent central nervous system stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity. Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine.</p>

Hello potential customers and returning customers. We have been trading cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and weed business for the past 7 years with very high quality items. We are not one of those “squares” who buy oz at a high price and put them in the store at a higher price to make a profit. We have connected well, so we can keep prices low because we buy high quantities at low prices. blue crystal meth</p>
<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading gumax-firstHeading">Methamphetamine</h1>
<p><b>Methamphetamine</b>, <b>Meth</b>. The first time they ever made or synthesized <b>methamphetamine</b> was in Japan in 1893 by a guy named Nagayoshi Nagai and he got it from ephedrine which oriental cultures had been interested in for a long time. They didnt get it into crystal meth form until 1919 when Akira Ogata from Japan made it by reduction using red phosphorous and iodine like the crank cooks do now.</p>
<p>Now when they first invented methamphetamine it didnt so much all ready have a use. Not a particular medical condition or disease that they came up with it to treat but instead they made it first and then started looking for what it might be good for. By the 1920s they were trying it on everything from depression to colds to whatever they could think of because surely such a powerful drug would be helpful medicine they thought.</p>
<p>Up until the 1930s you really couldnt find methamphetamine but what you found instead was amphetamine and that got used to catch a buzz back then because of the Great Depression and Prohibition where they made alcohol illegal in the US if you can imagine that! The thing about methamphetamine was that it could be made easy as the guy in Japan proved and because it dissolved in water people could inject the stuff in their veins. blue crystal meth</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_make_Methamphetamine" class="mw-headline">How to make Methamphetamine</span></h2>
<h3><span id="The_Red.2C_White_.26_Blue_Method" class="mw-headline">The Red, White &amp; Blue Method</span></h3>
<p>You need</p>
<ul>
<li>Ephedrine / Pseudoephedrine</li>
<li>Iodine</li>
<li>Red phosphorus</li>
<li>Ether</li>
<li>Hydrochloric Acid</li>
<li>Sodium hydroxide</li>
<li>Methanol</li>
</ul>
<p>The process for the Red White and Blue method means that equipment is gonna have to be used. The cooks use these things plus all the ingredients that i told about earlier.</p>
<pre>   - 3 Plastic jars with lids
   - Coffee filters
   - Eyedropper
   - Glass dish
   - Funnel
</pre>
<p>Now to start off they take those Sudafed pills and do what they call wash them in the ether. Because you know you dont want that dangerous red color in your crank! haha  blue crystal meth</p>
<p>They they crush up the pills and and put them into one of the jars so their like a powder. They put the methanol in there and shake it real hard and the length of time depends on who you ask but around twenty minutes sounds like what most of them say more or less. Then they leave it to settle and separate out which means that the psudeoephedrine part floats on the top and the wax and other crap in the pills goes to the bottom.</p>
<p>Then they put one of those coffee filters into a funnel and hold the funnel over the glass dish and they pour the seperated mixture with psudoephedrine into the glass dish but they say you got to be real careful so you just get the psuedoephedrine and not the other stuff into the glass dish. Of course thats got the alcohol from the methanol in there so you got to find a way to heat it that will burn off the alcohol but remember you cant see it burning. Some of them use an oven and some say a hairdryer. Obviously the fumes from this are gonna make you sick so they wear those painters masks over their mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Once they got the pseudoepehdrine all by itself they add it to another jar where theyve got iodine and red phosphorous and hydrochloric acid. They screw the lid on and shake the hell out of it for half an hour then leave it sit for another half an hour. Then they open it back up try not to breath the fumes and add in the sodium hydroxide. Now they leave the lid off and shake it gentle trying to swirl it until it gets cloudy looking which means the chemicals are reacting off each other. Then they add in ether and screw the lid back on so they can shake it for another 10 minutes. After that they leave it set for another 5 mins and then look for a middle layer in the jar. Theyll sit there tapping at it to get the middle layer as thin as possible which is what they want.</p>
<p>After that they go in with the eyedropped and start taking the middle layer off bit by bit but make sure you unscrewed the lid of the jar or this will be real hard to do! hahaha They want the whole top layer without getting any of the bottom layer because they throw that layer away and just keep the top. Then they fill up the third jar with water about half way and drop in 10 drops of hyrdrochloric acid to it. They they pour that top layer they sat there taking out with the eyedropper and put the lid on it. They shake that jar for another 10 minutes before they start using the eyedropper again to take off the top layer and throw that away. blue crystal meth</p>
<p>The bottom layer is what they want to keep and they evaporate it by heating which leaves behind crystals and those are the crank meth they’re cooking for. Simple as that so they say and some people will call this the cold cook method.</p>
<p>Remember that all the stuff they just used to make the crank cant be left where cops will find it because even if they did it wrong you still go to jail for having the ingredients and trying to put them together even if you didnt make the meth the right way.</p>

<h2><span id="Methamphetamine_teeths" class="mw-headline">Methamphetamine teeths</span></h2>
<p>Antidrug propaganda campaigns often show horrible “meth faces” and their totally burned out mouths. Methamphetamine addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, a condition known as “meth mouth”. This effect is not caused by any corrosive effects of the drug itself, which is a common myth. Meth mouth “is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth), extended periods of poor oral hygiene, frequent consumption of high calorie, carbonated beverages and tooth grinding and clenching. blue crystal meth</p>
