    <![CDATA[<h1><strong>Buy LSD Tabs</strong></h1>
<h2>What does LSD stand for ?</h2>
<p>The word LSD has many definitions (buy lsd tabs), the one which stands out for LSD in terms of lsd drug is ; “LSD” means ‘<span class="hvr">d-Lysergic</span> <span class="hvr">Acid</span> <span class="hvr">Diethylamide</span> <i><span class="hvr">(psychedelic</span> <span class="hvr">drug)’.</span></i></p>
<h2>What is LSD ? (buy lsd tabs)</h2>
<p>Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also known as acid. Its a chemical hallucinogen usually sold as small squares of paper, a liquid, or pellets (micro-dots)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An LSD experience is similar in many ways to psilocybin mushrooms, but often individuals feel like they are better able to direct and control the experience. LSD studies have shown success in treating depression, anxiety, smoking cessation, and many other psychological conditions. LSD consistently produces powerful long-term improvements in these conditions, even with just a single dose. Acid is a long-acting drug. It stays in the body 6 to 15 hours. Most acid trips won’t last more than <a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://journals.lww.com/jonmd/fulltext/2014/07000/Safety_and_Efficacy_of_Lysergic_Acid.1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9 hours</a>.</p>
<h3>Taking the right dose of LSD</h3>
<p>LSD is a powerful chemical and taking the correct dose is essential. Because LSD is active at very, very small quantities and because it is typically delivered on small pieces of paper, it is difficult to independently assess the dose (this issue is less of a problem with mushrooms or <a href="http://dragonvuyf5jqch4.onion/product/pure-mdma-95/">MDMA</a>). Taking too much LSD can lead to feelings of dissociation and alienation. A single ‘dose’ or ‘tab’ of LSD can vary widely in strength, so make sure you know the quantity in micrograms. Not at gettrippyshop you can <strong>Buy 1p LSD (1p-lsd) and buy LSD tabs</strong> at cheap prices.</p>
<p>Do not use LSD unless you are very confident of the quality and dose that you have. It’s best to use a source that someone you know has also used and can vouch for.</p>
<h2>How to take LSD Tabs (acid)</h2>
<p>The dose under your tongue and leave it there for about 10 minutes, until the paper mostly dissolves. Once you take the LSD, you will have about 30-60 minutes before the effects are strong. This is another chance to make sure you get setup with anything you will want to have handy. As the effects begin to occur, you will start to notice a change in your perception of the world. You may see some slight changes in your visual perception — subtle rainbow halos around lights, trails behind moving objects, geometric patterns when your eyes are closed, and moving or swirling or crawling patterns on surfaces.</p>
