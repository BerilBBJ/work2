DMT in solution degrades relatively fast and should be stored protected from air and light in a freezer. Highly pure DMT crystals, when evaporated out of a solvent and depositing upon glass, often produce small but highly defined white crystalline needles which when viewed under intense light will sparkle, and appear colorless under high magnification. In labs, it is observe to be explosive under a certain degree of heat.</p>
<h4><strong>Recomendations</strong></h4>
