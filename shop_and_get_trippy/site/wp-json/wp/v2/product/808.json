This ground is barren or lightly fertilized. If you find a mushroom on another spot, for example in a forest or on a tree, then it will certainly be no Liberty cap.<\/p>\n<p>They have a conical hat with pointed blotch. These have an average section of 5 up to 15 mm and are 6 to 13 mm high. When fresh they are olive green to greyish brown. If you let them dry they change into straw yellow or ochre. The spores are black to purple-brown. The lamellae are pale brown-grey to violet-brown. The stem is 5 up to 9 cm long with a section of approximately 1 up to 2 mm.<\/p>\n<p>The colour of the stem is whitish or cream. The base sometimes has a blue-green tint. The flesh of the cap is grey brown or beige. They have a mild taste and smell a bit like radish. They have a striking transparent slimy coat which you can pull off with tweezers.<\/p>\n<p>When you bend or snap them a little, a blue discolouring will be seen. If you see this colour you will know with certainty that you deal with Liberty caps. This colour appears because psilocybin oxidises when contacting air. Other mushrooms do not contain this substance and as a result do show the same discolouring.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Buy Liberty caps mushroom Commonly known as the\u00a0liberty cap, is a species\u00a0of\u00a0fungus which produces the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and baeocystin.
